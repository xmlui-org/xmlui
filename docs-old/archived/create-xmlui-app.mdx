# The `create-xmlui-app` Tool [#create-xlmui-app]

XMLUI has an accompanying tool, the `create-xmlui-app` tool, to accelerate the first step of creating an XMLUI-based app. This tool is a command-line utility that generates a simple development environment for your app. You can use this environment to construct the app and build the files for web deployment.

## Creating an XMLUI App

The tool is a standard Node.js package. To run it, you must have Node.js installed on your machine. Visit the [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download) of Node.js to get and install it if this is the first time you have done it.

### Select the App Root Folder

The XMLUI app you create will be in a folder encapsulating all files constituting the app. When the tool runs, it creates the app folder for you. Before running the tool, select a working folder with the `cd` command, which will hold the app folder:

```text
cd <working-folder>
```

### Create the Boilerplate Code

1. Open a command line tool (it may be the Terminal window in VS Code) and select your preferred working directory with the `cd` command.
2. Execute this command to download and start `create-xmlui-app`

```bash
npx create-xmlui-app@latest
```

The `npx` utility (part of the Node toolset) will download the `create-xmlui-app` package. Before installing it to your machine, it asks for a confirmation:

```
Need to install the following package:
  create-xmlui-app@<version>
Ok to proceed? (y)
```

(Here, `<version>` is the current version of the package). Press enter or `y` to go on; `n` to abandon.

1. After the package download (a few seconds), it starts and asks for your project name. Press Enter to accept the `my-app` default name or specify one. In this tutorial, we use the `my-first-app` project name.
2. You can optionally initialize a Git repo with your project. Press Enter (sign no Git repo) to go on.
3. The utility installs the `xmlui` package, the only direct dependency you need to develop XMLUI apps. That package will pull its dependencies automatically. After the download (it may take one or two minutes the first time), the tool sets up your XMLUI development project.
4. The project you created goes into its separate folder within the working folder from which you ran the `create-xmlui-app` command.

## Boilerplate Code Structure

The utility creates a Node package with all files required to develop, run, and build it. The structure of the package is simple:

<br/>
<Image alt="Boilerplate" src="/resources/images/get-started/boilerplate-structure.png" width={416} />

The `index.html` file wraps your entire app served with a web server. The `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are the standard Node package descriptor files.

Your primary focus is the `src` folder holding the application source code. Here, the `Main.xmlui` file contains the application's root component definition and may refer to other app components (besides the built-in XMLUI components). The app-specific components are in the `src/components` folder. An app may have one or more custom themes, and they are in the `src/themes` folder.

The `config.ts` file describes a few configuration values, such as the application's name to display, its logo, the default theme, URLs to access backends, etc. When you build the app, this file is turned into a configuration file you can change according to your production environment.

The `api.ts` file contains emulated API definitions that help you during application development.

The `public` folder contains the static resources (such as images, logos, fonts, etc) your app uses.

## Developing Your App

The boilerplate code contains a small application you can run with the `npm start` command. This command utilizes a dev web server within the package to run your app. This server runs in HMR (Hot Module Reloading) mode, which is very convenient: as you modify the app files, the server automatically refreshes your app according to the changes.

The command displays the local URL to access the app in your browser. Some tools (such as the terminal within Visual Studio Code, Sublime, and other code editors) allow you to click this URL. Otherwise, copy the URL and paste it into your browser's address bar.

```text {6}
$ npm start

> firstapp@0.1.0 start
> ui-engine start

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  âžœ  Network: use --host to expose
```

> **Note**: If you have multiple monitors or put your code editor and the running app side-by-side, you have a live preview. This feature accelerates the app development, as you do not need to stop and restart your app.

The `npm start` command runs in watch mode to detect your changes. You can exit the command with `Ctrl+C`.

### Creating a Build

Use the `npm run build` command to create a distribution folder. This command builds the app and creates a `dist` folder within your app folder. You can copy the content of this folder into your web server static files folder to serve the app.

To test the build locally, run the `npm run preview` command. Similarly to `npm start`, it spins up a local web server and displays its URL you can use in the browser:

```text {6}
$ npm run preview

> firstapp@0.1.0 preview
> ui-engine preview

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:4173/
  âžœ  Network: use --host to expose
```

> **Note**: This preview does not use HMR, so changing your app's code won't refresh the app in your browser, as it uses the files from the `dist` folder. If you have not built your app, the preview will display `Cannot /GET` as an indication of a 404 (Not Found) response status.

### Creating a Production Build

Executing the `npm run build-prod` creates an optimized build with a flat distribution folder. Instead of grouping the app files into folders, every build file is directly within `dist`.

> **Note**: You can use the `npm run preview` command to test the result of the production build.

### Creating a CI Build

Use the `npm run release-ci` command to build a zipped distribution file ready for continuous integration. This command builds the same `dist` folder as `npm run build-prod` and adds a `ui.zip` file to the app folder.

> **Note**: You can use the `npm run preview` command to test the result of the CI build. However, it will use the `dist` folder, not the `ui.zip` file.
