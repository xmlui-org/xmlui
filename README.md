# XMLUI

**XMLUI** is a framework for building user interfaces declaratively, with XML markup and flexible theming.

- **Easy to create**. Build on the web platform with little or no knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, or React.
- **Beautiful by default**. Enjoy themes that look great out of the box and are easy to modify.
- **Connected**. Read and write APIs with little or no scripting.
- **Modular**. Use a comprehensive suite of components that you can extend with — again! — little or no scripting.
- **Easy to deploy**. Just drop a handful of files onto a static webserver.

## Attribution

Our virtualized components and data management mechanisms would not be as simple, performant, and powerful without the help of a few [TanStack](https://github.com/TanStack) projects, such as [query](https://github.com/TanStack/query), [table](https://github.com/TanStack/table), and others. We appreciate the team's outstanding work!

We based some of our essential components on [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) components and involved some of the architectural approaches they used in their project. Thanks to all project contributors for their excellent work.

We loved the simple and beautiful UI style used by the [Tabler.io](https://tabler.io/) project; it illuminated our component design and theming. Thanks to [Paweł Kuna](https://github.com/codecalm) for this inspiration.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank all contributors to **xmlui** who have helped make this project possible.
