Our virtualized components and data management mechanisms would not be as simple, performant, and powerful without the help of a few [TanStack](https://github.com/TanStack) projects, such as [query](https://github.com/TanStack/query), [table](https://github.com/TanStack/table), and others. We appreciate the team's outstanding work!

We based some of our essential components on [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) components and involved some of the architectural approaches they used in their project. Thanks to all project contributors for their excellent work.

We loved the simple and beautiful UI style used by the [Tabler.io](https://tabler.io/) project; it illuminated our component design and theming. Thanks to [Paweł Kuna](https://github.com/codecalm) for this inspiration.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank all contributors to **xmlui** who have helped make this project possible.
