## Questions and Answers

### Question 1 (07:31)
**Model:** Claude Sonnet 4  
**Files in Context:** 
- qa-and-optimization.instructions.md
- log.md

**Question:** You recorded the model name in the log file as GitHub Copilot, however, I work with the Claude Sonnet 4 model. Update the instruction file to log the current LLM name. Also log the event if the LLM model changed during a session.

**Answer:** I'll update the instruction file to properly log the current LLM name and track model changes during sessions. Let me also correct the log file for this session.

I updated the instruction file to change:
- "Include the name of the model when recording a question." 
to:
- "Include the name of the current LLM model when recording a question. Log an event if the LLM model changes during a session."

I also corrected the model name in this session's log from "GitHub Copilot" to "Claude Sonnet 4".

### Question 2 (07:32)
**Model:** Claude Sonnet 4  
**Files in Context:** 
- qa-and-optimization.instructions.md
- log.md

**Question:** Add this instruction to the instructions file: Fix typos and tiny grammar issues in the question but do not change its style (that may change the meaning of the question).
Because there are now many points in the instructions file, reorder them into a more logical structure that is more straightforward for humans and AI.

**Answer:** I'll add the instruction about fixing typos and reorganize the instructions file for better logical flow and clarity.

I reorganized the instructions file into a more logical structure with clear sections:

**Session Setup** - How to initialize and start sessions
**Question Processing** - How to handle questions and typos  
**Agent Mode Operations** - How to handle file changes and actions
**Summary and Logging** - How to document results

I also added the new instruction: "Fix typos and tiny grammar issues in the question but do not change its style (that may change the meaning of the question)."

The structure is now more intuitive and easier to follow for both humans and AI, with numbered points within logical groupings.

### Question 3 (07:34)
**Model:** Claude Sonnet 4  
**Files in Context:** 
- qa-and-optimization.instructions.md
- log.md

**Question:** Add this action to the instructions file: whenever the instructions file changes, record its changes according to point 9 in the current instruction file, which says: "In agent mode, create subfolders for each question in the chat session folder, and save the original state and the new state (with a `_new` suffix) of the files that were changed in that question's subfolder."

**Answer:** I'll add an instruction to record changes to the instructions file itself according to point 9. Let me add this to the Agent Mode Operations section.

I added point 10 to the Agent Mode Operations section: "Whenever the instructions file changes, record its changes according to point 9 above."

I also updated the numbering in the Summary and Logging section (points 11-12) to maintain proper sequence.

Following the new rule, I created a subfolder for this question and saved both the original and new states of the instructions file:
