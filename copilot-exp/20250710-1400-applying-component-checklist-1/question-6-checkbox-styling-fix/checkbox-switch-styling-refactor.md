# Checkbox/Switch Styling Dependency Fix

## Summary
Successfully completed the refactoring of Checkbox and Switch component styling dependencies to resolve the issue identified in the Component QA Review where both components were dependent on `Toggle.module.scss` for their styling.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Separate Style Files

**`/Users/dotneteer/source/xmlui/xmlui/src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.module.scss`**
- Contains all Checkbox-specific styles including variants, hover states, focus states, and validation styles
- Includes shared mixins: `checkboxVariant`, `hoverAndDisabledState`, `checkedState`
- Includes base layout styles: `resetAppearance`, `label`, `inputContainer`
- Handles indeterminate state styling specific to checkboxes

**`/Users/dotneteer/source/xmlui/xmlui/src/components/Switch/Switch.module.scss`**
- Contains all Switch-specific styles including track, thumb, checked states, and validation styles
- Includes shared mixins: `hoverAndDisabledState`, `checkedState`
- Includes base layout styles: `resetAppearance`, `label`, `inputContainer`
- Handles CSS custom properties for switch sizing and animation

### 2. Updated Component Imports

**`Checkbox.tsx`**
- Changed import from `../Toggle/Toggle.module.scss` to `./Checkbox.module.scss`

**`Switch.tsx`**
- Changed import from `../Toggle/Toggle.module.scss` to `./Switch.module.scss`

### 3. Simplified Toggle Base Styles

**`Toggle.module.scss`**
- Reduced to only essential shared layout styles: `resetAppearance`, `label`, `inputContainer`
- Removed all component-specific styling (checkbox and switch styles)
- Removed theme variable collection and mixins (now handled in individual component files)

## Benefits

1. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each component now owns its styling, making maintenance easier
2. **Reduced Coupling**: Checkbox and Switch components are no longer dependent on each other's styles
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to Checkbox styling won't affect Switch and vice versa
4. **Clear Architecture**: Each component has its dedicated style file following the established pattern
5. **Preserved Functionality**: All existing styling behavior is maintained

## Verification

- ✅ Build completes successfully without errors
- ✅ No import or compilation errors in TypeScript/SCSS
- ✅ No linting errors related to the refactor
- ✅ All components maintain their existing functionality

## Next Steps

This refactor addresses the **Checkbox styling dependency** issue identified as **Critical Priority** in the Component QA Review. The styling architecture is now properly separated and follows best practices for component organization.

The next highest priority item from the Component QA Review would be to address the **deprecated HtmlTags component** removal, followed by implementing missing E2E tests for the 60+ components that currently lack them.
