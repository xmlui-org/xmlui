**Date:** July 7, 2025  
**Files Modified:** Avatar.spec.ts  
**Test Results:** All 7 edge case tests passing (9.3s execution time)  

### Summary

All edge case and name processing tests were found to be fully implemented and passing. The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of:

1. **Whitespace handling** - Empty and whitespace-only names
2. **International characters** - Accents, diacritics, Unicode support  
3. **Special characters** - Apostrophes, hyphens, symbols
4. **Length boundaries** - Single characters, very long names
5. **Case sensitivity** - Mixed case normalization
6. **Alphanumeric processing** - Numbers, letters, mixed content
7. **Unicode edge cases** - Emoji, special symbols

```

### Coverage Highlights

- **Robust name processing** - Handles real-world edge cases users might encounter
- **Unicode support** - Proper handling of international characters and emoji
