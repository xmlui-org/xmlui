# Issue Handling Strategy

We try to respond to reported issues immediately to help xmlui improve. This article summarizes our simple process.

## Bug Reports

1. The acting PO reads the bug report to understand the issue. Until the issue is reproduced, we will ask for more information from its reporter.
2. We decide what the team does with the issue: 
    - No fix: we do not fix the issue; mark it with the `wontfix` label. 
    - Not urgent: we put the issue in our backlog and will work on it according to current priorities (`bug` label).
    - Urgent: we move the issue to our board and start working on it immediately (`bug` label).
3. We communicate the fix's expected release (time window) -- provided we have enough info.
4. We communicate when the fix is complete (fix is merged back to `main`). 
5. We communicate when the particular release is published.
6. We let time for the reporter to check the fix (a week)
7. We close the issue

## Feature Requests

1. The acting PO checks if the feature request and the motivation are clear enough.
2. The team decides if we accept the feature request:
    - Not accepted: with a concise answer, the PO refuses it.
    - Accepted: the team puts the feature request into its backlog (and marks it with the `new request` label).
3. We communicate the significant steps and essential information about the feature development progress, including expected releases, the time window, etc.
4. We communicate when the feature is complete (it is merged back to `main`) and the particular release is published.
5. We close the issue.

## Questions

1. The acting PO checks if the question is clear enough (we understand the reporter's goal with the question).
2. The team answers the question accordingly.
3. If the question is essential and the answer may be helpful for many xmlui users, we turn it into an appropriate article (how-to) in the xmlui documentation.

## Other issues

1. The acting PO checks if an issue is a feature request or a bug report without using our particular templates. If so, we ask the reporter to use the appropriate template to report the issue.
2. In case of other issues, the team decides how we process it.
3. We communicate our decision with the reporter.
