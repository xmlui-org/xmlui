%-PROP-START completedNotificationMessage

This property customizes the success message displayed in a toast after the finished API invocation. The `$result` context variable can refer to the response body. For example, you can use the following code snippet to display the first 100 characters in the completed operation's response body:

```ueml copy
 <DataSource
  id="ds"
  url="/api/shopping-list" 
  completedNotificationMessage="Result: {JSON.stringify($result).substring(0, 100)}" />
```

%-PROP-START errorNotificationMessage

This property customizes the message displayed in a toast when the API invocation results in an error. The `$error.statusCode` context variable can refer to the response's status code, while `$error. details` to the response body. For example, you can use the following code snippet to display the status code and the details:

```ueml copy
 <DataSource
  id="ds"
  method="post"
  url="/api/shopping-list" 
  errorNotificationMessage="${error.statusCode}, {JSON.stringify($error.details)}" />
```

%-PROP-START resultSelector

The selector can be a simple dot notation path (e.g., `value.results`) or a JavaScript expression that processes the data (e.g., `results.filter(item => item.type === 'active')`). The selector has access to standard JavaScript array methods and operates on the full response body.
