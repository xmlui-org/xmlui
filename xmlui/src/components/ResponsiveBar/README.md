# ResponsiveBar Component

The ResponsiveBar component has been successfully created and tested! Here's what it does:

## Features

1. **Automatic overflow management**: When child components don't fit in the available width, they're automatically moved to a dropdown menu
2. **Real-time responsiveness**: The component monitors container width changes and adjusts the layout accordingly
3. **Zero configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
4. **Customizable overflow icon**: You can specify a custom icon for the dropdown trigger

## Usage Example

```xmlui
<ResponsiveBar>
  <Button label="File" />
  <Button label="Edit" />
  <Button label="View" />
  <Button label="Window" />
  <Button label="Help" />
</ResponsiveBar>
```

When the container is narrow, the last buttons (Window, Help) will be moved to a dropdown menu accessible via a "..." icon.

## Implementation Strategy

The component uses a two-phase rendering approach:

1. **Measurement phase**: All children are rendered invisibly to measure their widths
2. **Display phase**: Based on measurements, children are split between visible area and overflow dropdown

## Files Created

- `ResponsiveBar.tsx` - Main component with metadata and renderer
- `ResponsiveBarNative.tsx` - Native React implementation with size observation
- `ResponsiveBar.module.scss` - Styling with theme variables
- `ResponsiveBar.md` - Documentation with examples
- `ResponsiveBar.spec.ts` - End-to-end tests

## Integration

The component has been registered in the ComponentProvider and is ready to use in XMLUI applications!

## Testing

All tests pass:
- ✅ Renders children in horizontal layout
- ✅ Moves overflowing items to dropdown when container is too narrow
- ✅ Responds to container resize
