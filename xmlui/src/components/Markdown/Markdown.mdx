The \`Markdown\` component does not have properties. You must provide the text to display nested between an opening and a closing tag `<Markdown>`.

## Specifying the Text

As whitespaces (such as spaces and line breaks) have significance in Markdown, you should wrap the text between the `<![CDATA[` and `]]>` XMLUI tags, which preserve all whitespaces.

Indentation is also essential in Markdown. Start the markdown text in the first column as the following sample shows:

  horizontal={true}

# My Adventure in Markdown Land

## The Beginning

In the bustling city of Markdownville, I embarked on a journey to discover the secrets of Markdown.
My adventure started in the heart of the city, where the first rule of Markdown was inscribed in stone:

"To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase.
The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level."

Headings give hierarchy to text but sometimes **emphasizing something with bold is just enough**.

If not bold, then simply *italic letters give visual diversity*.

## Exploring Blockquotes

As I journeyed further, I encountered blockquotes that spoke of the beauty of simplicity:

> Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.
> > Like so

## The Power of Lists

I also discovered the power of lists, which were as versatile as the inhabitants of Markdownville:

- This is the first list item.
- Here's the second list item.
    - A subsection here would look great below the second list item.
- And here's the third list item.

I found that I can create ordered lists as well:

1. The first item.
2. The second item.
3. Third item.

## The Image

Text is not the only thing I found through my journey. The power of images materialized in front of me:

## Navigating with Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks, like signposts, marked other paths that branched off from the road I was treading:
- [Source of all truth](https://github.com/xmlui-com/xmlui)
- [Back to where we started](https://ncrm.azurewebsites.net/)

## The Horizontal Rule

In the quiet corners of Markdownville, I found the Horizontal Rule, a line that symbolizes the end of a section:

***
    ]]>
  </Markdown>
</App>
  `}
/>

The `Markdown` component supports these syntax elements:
- Heading
- Bold
- Italic
- Blockquote
- Ordered List
- Unordered List
- Code
- Horizontal Rule
- Link
- Image

These are also found in the **Basic Syntax** table of [this markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
Note that further components may be added later, like elements from the [Github Flavored Markdown syntax](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (such as tables and deteleted styling) but are not supported as of yet.

## Styling

The component itself cannot be styled.
However, the components that are used render the final text, have customizable style variables.

The components used to render the final styled text are either used as regular XMLUI components.
See the links for styling details:
[`Text`](./Text.mdx#styling)
[`Heading`](./Heading.mdx#styling)
[`Link`](./Link.mdx#styling)
[`Image`](./Image.mdx#styling)

Or they are components specifically created and used in the Markdown component.

> **Note**: components falling into this latter case are only available under the `Markdown` component.
> They cannot be instantiated in regular XMLUI.

These markdown-specific components are the following:

### Blockquote

A blockquote is a sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader.
Use the following styles to

- `accent-Blockquote`: sets the color of the strip running down on the left side of the block
- `color-bg-Blockquote`: sets the background color
- `margin-Blockquote`: sets the margin
- `padding-Blockquote`: sets the padding
- `radius-Blockquote`: sets the radius of the border for the block
- `shadow-Blockquote`: specifies the x offset, y offset, blur radius and color for the block shadow

```
"accent-Blockquote": "transparent",
"color-bg-Blockquote": "rgba(27, 195, 50, 0.3)",
"margin-Blockquote": "8px",
"padding-Blockquote": "16px",
"radius-Blockquote": "8px",
"shadow-Blockquote": "5px 10px 5px green"
```

<Playground
  name="Example: styling a horizontal rule"
  height={220}
  app={`<Markdown>
    <![CDATA[
> This text is in a blockquote.
> > This one has an even bigger emphasis, since it is nested.
> > > This one is nested even deeper.
> Continue the original block.
    ]]>
</Markdown>
  `}
  defaultTheme="custom"
  themes={[
    {
      id: "custom",
      name: "Custom Theme",
      themeVars: {
        "accent-Blockquote": "transparent",
        "color-bg-Blockquote": "rgba(27, 195, 50, 0.3)",
        "margin-Blockquote": "8px",
        "padding-Blockquote": "16px",
        "radius-Blockquote": "8px",
        "shadow-Blockquote": "5px 10px 5px green"
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

### HorizontalRule

Visually separates content.
The following determine how the rule should look like:

- `color-border-HorizontalRule`: changes the color
- `style-border-HorizontalRule`: changes the border style to any [CSS border style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-style), default is `solid`
- `thickness-border-HorizontalRule`: changes how tall the rule should be, default is 1px

```
"color-border-HorizontalRule": "red",
"style-border-HorizontalRule": "dotted",
"thickness-border-HorizontalRule": "8px"
```

<Playground
  name="Example: styling a horizontal rule"
  height={100}
  app={`<Markdown>
    <![CDATA[
Section 1

---

Section 2
    ]]>
</Markdown>
  `}
  defaultTheme="custom"
  themes={[
    {
      id: "custom",
      name: "Custom Theme",
      themeVars: {
        "color-border-HorizontalRule": "red",
        "thickness-border-HorizontalRule": "8px",
        "style-border-HorizontalRule": "dotted"
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

> **Note**: The `HorizontalRule` component looks similar to the `ContentSeparator` component.
> They are not the same and are styled separately.

### ListItem

These are the elements in an ordered or unordered list.

- `padding-left-ListItem`: determines how big the gap should be between the list item contents and the item marker

```
"padding-left-ListItem": "40px"
```

<Playground
  name="Example: styling a list item"
  height={100}
  app={`<Markdown>
    <![CDATA[
1. Get in the driver's seat and buckle up
2. Insert the key into the ignition
3. Put the gearstick in either the "P" or "N" position
4. Twist the ignition key to start the car
    ]]>
</Markdown>
  `}
  defaultTheme="custom"
  themes={[
    {
      id: "custom",
      name: "Custom Theme",
      themeVars: {
        "padding-left-ListItem": "40px"
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

### OrderedList

An ordered list with arabic numbers as markers.
Lists can be nested into one another.
If nested, the counter will start anew.

- `padding-left-OrderedList`: determines how much space the list should have from the left

```
"padding-left-OrderedList": "80px"
```

<Playground
  name="Example: styling an ordered list"
  height={100}
  app={`<Markdown>
    <![CDATA[
1. Get in the driver's seat and buckle up
2. Insert the key into the ignition
3. Put the gearstick in either the "P" or "N" position
4. Twist the ignition key to start the car
    ]]>
</Markdown>
  `}
  defaultTheme="custom"
  themes={[
    {
      id: "custom",
      name: "Custom Theme",
      themeVars: {
        "padding-left-OrderedList": "80px"
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

### UnorderedList

An unordered list with marker symbols.
Lists can be nested into one another.
Different levels of nested lists will have different markers.

- `padding-left-UnorderedList`: determines how much space the list should have from the left

```
"padding-left-UnorderedList": "80px"
```

<Playground
  name="Example: styling an unordered list"
  height={200}
  app={`<Markdown>
    <![CDATA[
- Get in the driver's seat and buckle up
- Insert the key into the ignition
- Put the gearstick in either the "P" or "N" position
- Twist the ignition key to start the car
- Know that cars may refuse to start for any number of reasons
    - Consult your car's manual
    - Take your car to a mechanic
        - If all else fails, troubleshoot the car yourself
    ]]>

  defaultTheme="custom"
  themes={[
    {
      id: "custom",
      name: "Custom Theme",
      themeVars: {
        "padding-left-UnorderedList": "80px"
      },
    },
  ]}
/>
