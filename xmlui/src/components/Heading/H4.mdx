The `H4` component is a shorthand version of the `Heading` element with its `level` property set to "h4".

See also: [Heading](./Heading), [H1](./H1), [H2](./H2), [H3](./H3), [H5](./H5), [H6](./H6).

```ueml copy
<H4 value="This is a H4 text" />
```

    <H4 value="This is a H4 text" />
  </Stack>
  `}
/>

## Styling

The `H4` component inherits its visual style from the `Heading` component.
Using the `H4` component specifier, you can override the inherited theme variable values.
For example, the `color-text-H4` theme variable sets the text color of `H4` while keeping the color of all other headings.
