# H2

The `H2` component is a shorthand version of the `Heading` element with its `level` property set to "h2".

See also: [H1](./H1), [H3](./H3), [H4](./H4), [H5](./H5), [H6](./H6).

```ueml copy
<H2 value="This is a H2 text" />
```

  </Stack>
  `}
/>

## Styling

The `H2` component inherits its visual style from the `Heading` component.
Using the `H2` component specifier, you can override the inherited theme variable values.
For example, the `color-text-H2` theme variable sets the text color of `H2` while keeping the color of all other headings.
