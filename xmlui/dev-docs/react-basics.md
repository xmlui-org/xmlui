# React Fundamentals

The current implementation of xmlui is built with React. Though the concepts behind the framework are not React-specific, we chose this platform because of its simplicity, the dev team's existing knowledge, and the large number of available third-party components.

The xmlui framework uses React hooks in its components. This article overviews the fundamental React hook concepts that may help you read, understand, and maintain the xmlui source code.

We assume that you are familiar with the React fundamentals (you already went through the [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn).

## Component Rendering

Most issues with faulty React components (unexpected display or behavior) result from a lack of understanding of React's rendering loop. Here is a summary:

1. **Render Trigger**. The loops starts with something that triggers the rendering of a particular component. There are a few of them:
  - The parent of the component is re-rendered.
  - Any property of a component is changed.
  - Any state variable of the component is changed.
2. **Render Phase**. React calls your component function or render() method, which returns a new virtual DOM structure.
3. **Reconciliation**. React compares the new virtual DOM (returned by the `render()` method) with the old virtual DOM using its diffing algorithm, and it determines the minimal set of changes needed for the real DOM.
4. **Commit Phase**. React updates the real DOM based on the changes found during reconciliation. It runs any layout effects and then runs side-effect callbacks (e.g., useEffect).
5. **Post-Render Cleanup**. Cleanup functions from useEffect (or similar) run to tidy up before the subsequent renders.

When designing your components, you can implement components with poor performance. Keep these suggestions in mind:
- Re-rendering parent components renders all nested children (even if no child has been changed), so use a design that changes only a minimal part of the UI.
- Use memoization (`useMemo`) to re-render only the children that have been changed.

## How to Use React Hooks

There are a few things to consider when using React hooks. Ignoring one of these may result in difficult-to-resolve issues.

**The order of hook calls must be consistent between renders; if the particular component is rendered multiple times, all renders must invoke the same hooks in the same order.** Take care of the following:
- Place hooks at the top of your component or custom hook above any early returns or logic branches.
- Donâ€™t use hooks in regular JavaScript functions or classes.
- Donâ€™t call hooks in nested functions, loops, or conditionals.

You should use the correct hook for a particular job. Later in this section, you will learn more detail.

### `useState`

[`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) adds a state variable to a particular component. State variables store values that directly influence components' rendering (appearance). Whenever a particular state changes, the component is re-rendered.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  // Declare a piece of state for the counter
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Increment and decrement handlers
  const increment = () => setCount(prev => prev + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(prev => prev - 1);

  // Return JSX to render
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>+1</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-1</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
