**Fundamentals**
- [React Fundamentals](./react-fundamentals.md)
- [Standalone Rendering Architecture](./standalone-app.md)
- [Container-Based State Management](./containers.md)
- ...

**Rendering Techniques**
- [Component Behaviors](./component-behaviors.md)

  - TypeScript support and error handling

- **How routing and navigation work** ✓ _[containers.md]_
  - Router provider integration (BrowserRouter/HashRouter/MemoryRouter) ✓
  - Route parameter extraction and query string parsing ✓
  - Routing context variables: $pathname, $routeParams, $queryParams, $linkInfo ✓
