# Components Overview [#components-overview]

| Component | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| [APICall](./APICall) | `APICall` creates, updates or deletes data on the backend, versus [`DataSource`](/components/DataSource) which fetches data. Unlike DataSource, APICall doesn't automatically execute - you must trigger it manually with the `execute()` method, typically from form submissions or button clicks. |
| [App](./App) | The `App` component is the root container that defines your application's overall structure and layout. It provides a complete UI framework with built-in navigation, header, footer, and content areas that work together seamlessly. |
| [AppHeader](./AppHeader) | `AppHeader` defines the top navigation bar of your application within the [`App`](/components/App) component. It automatically handles logo placement, application title, and user profile areas with built-in responsive behavior. |
| [AppState](./AppState) | `AppState` is an invisible component that provides global state management across your entire application. Unlike component variables that are scoped locally, AppState allows any component to access and update shared state without prop drilling. |
| [AutoComplete](./AutoComplete) | `AutoComplete` is a searchable dropdown input that allows users to type and filter through options, with support for single or multiple selections. Unlike a basic [`Select`](/components/Select), it provides type-ahead functionality and can allow users to create new options. |
| [Avatar](./Avatar) | `Avatar` displays a user or entity's profile picture as a circular image, with automatic fallback to initials when no image is provided. It's commonly used in headers, user lists, comments, and anywhere you need to represent a person or organization. |
| [Backdrop](./Backdrop) | The `Backdrop` component is a semi-transparent overlay that appears on top of its child component to obscure or highlight the content behind it. |
| [Badge](./Badge) | `Badge` displays small text labels with colored backgrounds, commonly used for status indicators, categories, tags, and counts. It supports dynamic color mapping based on content values, useful for status systems and data categorization. |
| [BarChart](./BarChart) | `BarChart` displays data as horizontal or vertical bars, supporting both grouped and stacked layouts. It's ideal for comparing values across categories, showing revenue trends, or displaying any quantitative data over time or categories. |
| [Bookmark](./Bookmark) | As its name suggests, this component places a bookmark into its parent component's view. The component has an `id` that you can use in links to navigate (scroll to) the bookmark's location. |
| [Breakout](./Breakout) | The `Breakout` component creates a breakout section. It allows its child to occupy the entire width of the UI even if the app or the parent container constrains the maximum content width. |
| [Button](./Button) | `Button` is the primary interactive component for triggering actions like form submissions, navigation, opening modals, and API calls. It supports multiple visual styles and sizes to match different UI contexts and importance levels. |
| [Card](./Card) | `Card` is a versatile container that groups related content with a visual boundary, typically featuring background color, padding, borders, and rounded corners. It's ideal for organizing information, creating sections, and establishing visual hierarchy in your interface. |
| [Carousel](./Carousel) | This component displays a slideshow by cycling through elements (images, text, or custom slides) like a carousel. |
| [ChangeListener](./ChangeListener) | `ChangeListener` is an invisible component that watches for changes in values and triggers actions in response. It's essential for creating reactive behavior when you need to respond to data changes, state updates, or component property modifications outside of normal event handlers. |
| [Checkbox](./Checkbox) | `Checkbox` allows users to make binary choices with a clickable box that shows checked/unchecked states. It's essential for settings, preferences, multi-select lists, and accepting terms or conditions. |
| [CHStack](./CHStack) | This component represents a stack that renders its contents horizontally and aligns that in the center along both axes. |
| [ColorPicker](./ColorPicker) | `ColorPicker` enables users to choose colors by specifying RGB, HSL, or HEX values. |
| [Column](./Column) | `Column` defines the structure and behavior of individual table columns within a [`Table`](/components/Table) component. Each Column controls data binding, header display, sorting capabilities, sizing, and can contain any XMLUI components for rich cell content. |
| [ContentSeparator](./ContentSeparator) | `ContentSeparator` creates visual dividers between content sections using horizontal or vertical lines. It's essential for improving readability by breaking up dense content, separating list items, or creating clear boundaries between different UI sections. |
| [CVStack](./CVStack) | This component represents a stack that renders its contents vertically and aligns that in the center along both axes. |
| [DataSource](./DataSource) | `DataSource` fetches and caches data from API endpoints, versus [`APICall`](/components/APICall) which creates, updates or deletes data. |
| [DateInput](./DateInput) | `DateInput` provides a text-based date input interface for selecting single dates or date ranges, with direct keyboard input similar to TimeInput. It offers customizable formatting and validation options without dropdown calendars. |

| [RadioGroup](./RadioGroup) | `RadioGroup` creates a mutually exclusive selection interface where users can choose only one option from a group of radio buttons. It manages the selection state and ensures that selecting one option automatically deselects all others in the group.

Radio options store their values as strings. Numbers and booleans are converted to strings when assigned, while objects, functions and arrays default to an empty string unless resolved via binding expressions. |
| [RealTimeAdapter](./RealTimeAdapter) | `RealTimeAdapter` is a non-visual component that listens to real-time events. |
| [Redirect](./Redirect) | `Redirect` immediately redirects the browser to the URL in its `to` property when it gets visible (its `when` property gets `true`). It works only within [App](/components/App), not externally. |
