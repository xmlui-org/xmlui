# TabItem [#tabitem]

`TabItem` defines individual tabs within a [Tabs](/components/Tabs) component, providing both the tab header label and the content that displays when the tab is selected. As a non-visual structural component, it serves as a container that organizes content into distinct, switchable sections.

**Key features:**
- **Label definition**: Provides the clickable tab header text via the label property
- **Content container**: Wraps any child components that display when the tab is active
- **Structural organization**: Creates the relationship between tab headers and their corresponding content
- **Seamless integration**: Designed exclusively for use within [Tabs](/components/Tabs) components

**Usage pattern:**
Always used as a direct child of [Tabs](/components/Tabs) components. The `label` property defines the tab button text, while child components placed within the TabItem provide the content that displays when the tab is selected.
