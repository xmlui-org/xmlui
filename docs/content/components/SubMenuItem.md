# SubMenuItem [#submenuitem]

`SubMenuItem` creates hierarchical menu structures by acting as both a menu item and a container for nested menu items. When clicked or hovered, it reveals a submenu containing additional [MenuItem](/components/MenuItem), [MenuSeparator](/components/MenuSeparator), or other [SubMenuItem](/components/SubMenuItems) components, enabling complex multi-level navigation and action organization.

**Key features:**
- **Hierarchical nesting**: Creates multi-level menu structures within [DropdownMenu](/components/DropdownMenu) components
- **Dual functionality**: Acts as both a clickable menu item and a container for other menu components
- **Custom triggers**: Configurable trigger appearance via triggerTemplate property
- **Progressive disclosure**: Reveals nested options on hover or click interaction
- **Unlimited depth**: Supports multiple levels of nesting for complex menu hierarchies
