# Contact List Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will create a Contact List app from scratch using XMLUI. This app lets you manage a small database tracking your contacts.

This app will implement a complete client-server scenario, allowing easy access to a database through a REST API to retrieve and store data. Importantly, you will not need to build and manage an actual backend with some database. The **XMLUI API interceptor** technology will seamlessly emulate this backend, relieving you of this complex task.

When the app is complete, it will provide this functionality:

- Displaying a contact list, filtering and sectioning it by contact categories
- Adding new contacts, editing, and deleting contacts from the database
- Showing a dashboard
