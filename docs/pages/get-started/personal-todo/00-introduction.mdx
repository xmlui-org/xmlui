# Overview

In this tutorial, you will create a Personal Todo app from scratch using XMLUI. This app lets you manage a small database that keeps track of your todo items.

This app will implement a complete client-server scenario, allowing easy access to a database through a REST API to retrieve and store data. Importantly, you will not need to build and manage an actual backend with some database. The API interceptor technology will seamlessly emulate this backend, relieving you of this complex task.

When the app is complete, it will provide this functionality:

- Displaying a task list, filtering and sectioning it by topics
- Adding new tasks, editing, and deleting tasks from the database
- Showing a task board

Here are a few screenshots:
