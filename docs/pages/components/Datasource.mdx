# DataSource

The `Datasource` component manages fetching data from a web API endpoint. This component automatically manages the complexity of the fetch operation and caching. To manipulate data on the backend, use the [`ApiAction`](./ApiAction.mdx) component.

## Context Variables

This component does not have any context variables.

## Properties

### `body`

This property sets the request body. The object you pass here will be serialized to JSON when sending the request. Use the `rawBody` property to send another request body using its native format. When you define `body` and `rawBody`, the latest one prevails.

### `completedNotificationMessage`

This property defines the message to display automatically when the data fetch operation has been completed.

### `errorNotificationMessage`

This property defines the message to display automatically when the data fetch operation results in an error.

### `headers`

You can define request header values as key and value pairs, where the key is the ID of the particular header and the value is that header's value.

### `inProgressNotificationMessage`

This property defines the message to display while the fetch operation progresses.

### `method`

By default, data fetching uses the `get` operation method. You can change it by setting this property to other supported methods, such as `post`, `put`, `delete`, and others.

### `nextPageParamSelector`

When using `Datasource` with paging, the response may contain information about the previous and next page. This property defines the selector that extracts the next page information from the response deserialized to an object.

### `pollIntervalInSeconds`

By setting this property, you can define periodic data fetching. The `Datasource` component will refresh its data according to the time specified as seconds. When the data changes during the refresh, it will trigger the update mechanism of XMLUI and re-render the UI accordingly.

### `prevPageParamSelector`

When using `Datasource` with paging, the response may contain information about the previous and next page. This property defines the selector that extracts the previous page information from the response deserialized to an object.

### `queryParams`

This property sets the request body. The object you pass here will be serialized to JSON when sending the request. Use the `rawBody` property to send another request body using its native format. When you define `body` and `rawBody`, the latest one prevails.

### `rawBody`

This property sets the request body to the value provided here without any conversion. Use the `body` property if you want the object sent in JSON. When you define `body` and `rawBody`, the latest one prevails.

### `resultSelector`

The response of a data-fetching query may include additional information that the UI cannot (or does not intend) to process. With this property, you can define a selector that extracts the data from the response body.

### `url`

This property represents the URL to fetch the data.

## API

This component does not provide any API.

## Events

### `error`

This event fires when a request results in an error.

### `loaded`

The component triggers this event when the fetch operation has been completed and the data is loaded. The argument of the event is the data loaded.

## Styling

This component does not have any styles.
