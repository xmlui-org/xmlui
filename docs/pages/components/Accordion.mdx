# Accordion

(**NOT IMPLEMENTED YET**) The `Accordion` component is a collapsible container that toggles the display of content sections. It helps organize information by expanding or collapsing it based on user interaction.

## Context Variables

## Properties

### `collapsedIcon`

This property is the name of the icon that is displayed when the accordion is collapsed.

### `expandedIcon`

This property is the name of the icon that is displayed when the accordion is expanded.

### `hideIcon`

This property indicates that the trigger icon is not displayed (`true`).

Default value: `false`.

### `rotateExpanded`

This optional property defines the rotation angle of the expanded icon (relative to the collapsed icon).
