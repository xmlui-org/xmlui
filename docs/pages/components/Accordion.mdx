# Accordion [#component-accordion]

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">This component's implementation is **in progress**. This documentation shows the component's planned interface.</Callout>

(**NOT IMPLEMENTED YET**) The `Accordion` component is a collapsible container that toggles the display of content sections. It helps organize information by expanding or collapsing it based on user interaction.

## Properties

### `collapsedIcon`

This property is the name of the icon that is displayed when the accordion is collapsed.

### `expandedIcon`

This property is the name of the icon that is displayed when the accordion is expanded.

### `hideIcon`

This property indicates that the trigger icon is not displayed (`true`).

Default value: `false`.

### `rotateExpanded`

This optional property defines the rotation angle of the expanded icon (relative to the collapsed icon).

If this property has a value, only the collapsed icon is used. When the accordion is expanded, the collapsed icon is rotated with this angle.

### `triggerPosition`

This property indicates the position where the trigger icon should be displayed. The `start` value signs the trigger is before the header text (template), and `end` indicates that it follows the header.

Default value: `"end"`.

Available values: `start`, `end` **(default)**
