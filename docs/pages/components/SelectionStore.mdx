# SelectionStore [#component-selectionstore]

The `SelectionStore` is a non-visual component that may wrap components (items) and manage their selection state to accommodate the usage of other actions.

For an example that covers all props, and API methods and values, see the [\`Selection-Aware Components\`](#selection-aware-components) section.

## Using `SelectionStore`

A `SelectionStore` instance is a mediator between a component that can manage a list of selected items and the external context.
The wrapped component can report its selection state (which items are currently selected);
so that the external context can access and manage the selection state through the component's API.

## Selection-Aware Components

Some components know they are wrapped with a `SelectionStore` and manage their current selection state through it.
For example, the following sample `SelectionStore` wraps a `Table` with its `rowsSelectable` property set to true.
Whenever the user changes the selection state of a particular row, the `SelectionStore` updates its state accordingly.

```xmlui copy
<App>
  <H3>Rockets {rockets.value.length ? "(" + rockets.value.length + " selected)" : ""}</H3>
  <HStack>
    <Button label="Select First" 
      onClick="if (rockets.value?.length) rockets.setSelectedRowIds([rockets.value[0].id])" />
    <Button label="Refresh Table" onClick="rockets.refreshSelection()" />
    <Button label="Clear Selection" onClick="rockets.clearSelection()" />
  </HStack>
  <SelectionStore id="rockets">
    <Table
      width="100%"
      rowsSelectable="{true}"
      data="https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/rockets"
      height="300px">
      <Column header="Image" size="80px">
        <Image height="80px" fit="cover" src="{$item.flickr_images[0]}"/>
      </Column>
      <Column canSort="true" bindTo="country"/>
      <Column canSort="true" bindTo="company"/>
    </Table>
  </SelectionStore>
</App>
```

The UI refreshes the number of selected items as you check or uncheck the rows in the following table:

  name="Example: using SelectionStore"
  app={`
    <App>
      <H3>Rockets {rockets.value.length ? "(" + rockets.value.length + " selected)" : ""}</H3>
      <HStack>
        <Button label="Select First" 
          onClick="if (rockets.value?.length) rockets.setSelectedRowIds([rockets.value[0].id])" />
        <Button label="Refresh Table" onClick="rockets.refreshSelection()" />
        <Button label="Clear Selection" onClick="rockets.clearSelection()" />
      </HStack>
      <SelectionStore id="rockets">
        <Table
          width="100%"
          rowsSelectable="{true}"
          data="https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/rockets"
          height="300px">
          <Column header="Image" size="80px">
            <Image height="80px" fit="cover" src="{$item.flickr_images[0]}"/>
          </Column>
          <Column canSort="true" bindTo="country"/>
          <Column canSort="true" bindTo="company"/>
        </Table>
      </SelectionStore>
    </App>
  `}
/>
