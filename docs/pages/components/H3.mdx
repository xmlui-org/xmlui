# H3 [#component-h3]

This component is inherited from [Heading](./Heading.mdx)

See also: [H1](./H1.mdx), [H2](./H2.mdx), [H4](./H4.mdx), [H5](./H5.mdx), [H6](./H6.mdx)

The `H3` component is a shorthand version of the `Heading` element with its `level` property set to "h3".

```ueml copy
<H3 value="This is a H3 text" />
```

<Playground
  name="H3 example"
  previewOnly
  height={100}
  app={`
  <Stack>
    <H3 value="This is a H3 text" />
  </Stack>
  `}
/>

## Styling

The `H3` component inherits its visual style from the `Heading` component.
Using the `H3` component specifier, you can override the inherited theme variable values.
For example, the `color-text-H3` theme variable sets the text color of `H3` while keeping the color of all other headings.
