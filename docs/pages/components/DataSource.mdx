# DataSource [#component-datasource]

The `DataSource` component manages fetching data from a web API endpoint. This component automatically manages the complexity of the fetch operation and caching. To manipulate data on the backend, use the [`APICall`](./APICall.mdx) component.



## Properties

### `body (optional)`

This property sets the request body. The object you pass here will be serialized to JSON when sending the request. Use the `rawBody` property to send another request body using its native format. When you define `body` and `rawBody`, the latest one prevails.

### `completedNotificationMessage (optional)`

This property defines the message to display automatically when the data fetch operation has been completed.

This property customizes the success message displayed in a toast after the finished API invocation. The `$result` context variable can refer to the response body. For example, you can use the following code snippet to display the first 100 characters in the completed operation's response body:

```ueml copy
 <DataSource
  id="ds"
  url="/api/shopping-list" 
  completedNotificationMessage="Result: {JSON.stringify($result).substring(0, 100)}" />
```

### `errorNotificationMessage (optional)`

This property defines the message to display automatically when the data fetch operation results in an error.

This property customizes the message displayed in a toast when the API invocation results in an error. The `$error.statusCode` context variable can refer to the response's status code, while `$error. details` to the response body. For example, you can use the following code snippet to display the status code and the details:

```ueml copy
 <DataSource
  id="ds"
  method="post"
  url="/api/shopping-list" 
  errorNotificationMessage="${error.statusCode}, {JSON.stringify($error.details)}" />
```

%-PROP-START resultSelector

The selector can be a simple dot notation path (e.g., `value.results`) or a JavaScript expression that processes the data (e.g., `results.filter(item => item.type === 'active')`). The selector has access to standard JavaScript array methods and operates on the full response body.

### `headers (optional)`

You can define request header values as key and value pairs, where the key is the ID of the particular header and the value is that header's value.

### `inProgressNotificationMessage (optional)`

This property defines the message to display while the fetch operation progresses.

### `method (optional)`

By default, data fetching uses the `get` operation method. You can change it by setting this property to other supported methods, such as `post`, `put`, `delete`, and others.

### `nextPageSelector (optional)`

When using `DataSource` with paging, the response may contain information about the previous and next page. This property defines the selector that extracts the next page information from the response deserialized to an object.

### `pollIntervalInSeconds (optional)`

By setting this property, you can define periodic data fetching. The `DataSource` component will refresh its data according to the time specified as seconds. When the data changes during the refresh, it will trigger the update mechanism of XMLUI and re-render the UI accordingly.

### `prevPageSelector (optional)`

When using `DataSource` with paging, the response may contain information about the previous and next page. This property defines the selector that extracts the previous page information from the response deserialized to an object.

### `queryParams (optional)`

This property sets the request body. The object you pass here will be serialized to JSON when sending the request. Use the `rawBody` property to send another request body using its native format. When you define `body` and `rawBody`, the latest one prevails.

### `rawBody (optional)`

This property sets the request body to the value provided here without any conversion. Use the `body` property if you want the object sent in JSON. When you define `body` and `rawBody`, the latest one prevails.

### `resultSelector (optional)`

The response of a data-fetching query may include additional information that the UI cannot (or does not intend) to process. With this property, you can define a selector that extracts the data from the response body.

The selector can be a simple dot notation path (e.g., `value.results`) or a JavaScript expression that processes the data (e.g., `results.filter(item => item.type === 'active')`). The selector has access to standard JavaScript array methods and operates on the full response body.

### `transformResult (optional)`

This property accepts a transformation function that receives the data coming from the backend after it has been through the evaluation of the optional `resultSelector` property. The function gets the entire result set and can transform it. The `DataSource` component `value` property will return the data from this function.

### `url (required)`

This property represents the URL to fetch the data.

## Events

### `error`

This event fires when a request results in an error.

### `loaded`

The component triggers this event when the fetch operation has been completed and the data is loaded. The argument of the event is the data loaded.

## Exposed Methods

This component does not expose any methods.
