# RawHtml [#component-rawhtml]

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸ“”">This component is in an **experimental** state; you can use it in your app. However, we may modify it, and it may even have breaking changes in the future.</Callout>

This component injects a raw HTML string into the DOM.



## Using the Component

This component injects a raw HTML string into the DOM. React does not allow direct rendering of an HTML string, so the content passed to this component is rendered in a `div` or a `span` tag according to the `host element` property.

<Callout type="warning">
Injecting raw HTML may create security concerns and make your app vulnerable to malicious attacks! Be sure to inject only sanitized code as raw HTML.
</Callout>

You can also use xmlui layout properties to add style settings to the host tag:

```ueml copy /backgroundColor/ /zoom/
<App>
  <RawHtml 
    content="<h1>Heading 1: Hello, World!</h1>" 
    backgroundColor="cyan" 
    zoom="300%" />
</App>
```

<Playground
  name="Example: Using the RawHtml component"
  app={`
    <App>
      <RawHtml content="<h1>Heading 1: Hello, World!</h1>" backgroundColor="cyan" zoom="300%" />
    </App>
  `}
/>

<Callout type="warning">
The appearance of the rendered raw HTML content is determined by the current xmlui rendering context (including orientation, gaps, paddings, etc.). You can influence this context only through layout properties. 

Any additional styling requires CSS hacks, which may break the planned layout and the theming.
</Callout>

You can pass the raw HTML content in a CDATA child:

```ueml copy {3-5}
<App>
  <RawHtml backgroundColor="lightgreen" zoom="300%">
    <![CDATA[
      <h1>Heading 1: Hello, World!</h1>
    ]]>
  </RawHtml>
</App>
```

<Playground
  name="Example: Using the RawHtml component with child content"
  app={`
    <App>
      <RawHtml backgroundColor="lightgreen" zoom="300%">
        <![CDATA[
          <h1>Heading 1: Hello, World!</h1>
        ]]>
      </RawHtml>
    </App>
  `}
/>
