# Image

The `Image` component represents or depicts an object, scene, idea, or other concept with a picture.

## Properties

### `alt`

This property specifies an alternate text for the image.

This is useful in two cases:
1. Accessibility: screen readers read the prop value to users so they know what the image is about.
2. The text is also displayed when the image can't be loaded for some reason (network errors, content blocking, etc.).

```ueml copy
<Image src="cantFindIt.jpg" alt="This image depicts a wonderful scene not for human eyes" />
```

<Playground
  previewOnly
  name="Example: alt"
  height={60}
  app={`<Image src="cantFindIt.jpg" alt="This image depicts a wonderful scene not for human eyes" />`}
/>

### `aspectRatio`

This property sets a preferred aspect ratio for the image, which will be used in the calculation of auto sizes and some other layout functions.

```ueml copy
<Image src="/resources/images/components/image/breakfast.jpg" aspectRatio="1420 / 934" />
```

<Playground
  previewOnly
  name="Example: aspectRatio"
  height={300}
  app={` <Image src="/resources/images/components/image/breakfast.jpg" aspectRatio="200 / 150" /> `}
/>

### `fit`

This property sets how the image content should be resized to fit its container.

| Name      | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| `contain` | The replaced content is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the image's container. The entire image is made to fill the container. |
| `cover`   | The image is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the element's entire content box. If the image's aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of its container, then the image will be clipped to fit. |

```ueml copy /fit/
<HStack padding="1rem" height="280px" gap="1rem">
  <Image src="/resources/images/components/image/breakfast.jpg" fit="contain" width="240px" />
  <Image src="/resources/images/components/image/breakfast.jpg" fit="cover" width="240px" />
</HStack>
```

<Playground
  previewOnly
  name="Example: fit"
  height={300}
  app={`
  <HStack padding="1rem" height="280px" gap="1rem">
    <Image src="/resources/images/components/image/breakfast.jpg" fit="contain" width="240px" />
    <Image src="/resources/images/components/image/breakfast.jpg" fit="cover" width="240px" />
  </HStack>
  `}
/>

### `lazyLoad`

Lazy loading instructs the browser to load the image only when it is imminently needed (e.g. user scrolls to it). The default value is eager (`false`).

    fit="cover"
    onClick="window.alert('Image clicked')"
  />
</Stack>
```
