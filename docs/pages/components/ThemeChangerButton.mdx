# ThemeChangerButton

`ThemeChangerButton` is a component that allows to switch between available themes.

## Using the Component

The component is a button that can be used the same way as a regular [`Button`](./Button.mdx).

<Playground
  name="Use case"
  previewOnly
  height={400}
  app={`
  <Stack height="100%" verticalAlignment="center" horizontalAlignment="center">
    <ThemeChangerButton />
  </Stack>
  `}
/>

It automatically handles custom themes as well that are added to your project:

**NOTE:** Issue arises if no tone suffix is provided in the theme ID (like `custom-light`).

```json
themes: {
  [
    {
      id: "custom",
      tone: "light",
      name: "Custom Theme",
      themeVars: {
        "radius-TextBox": "30px",
        "color-adornment-TextBox": "red",
        "thickness-border-TextBox": "4px"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Playground
  name="Example: custom theme"
  previewOnly
  height={400}
  defaultTheme="custom"
  themes={[
    {
      id: "custom",
      tone: "light",
      name: "Custom Theme",
      themeVars: {
        "radius-TextBox": "30px",
        "color-adornment-TextBox": "red",
        "thickness-border-TextBox": "4px",
      },
    },
  ]}
  app={`
  <Stack height="100%" verticalAlignment="center" horizontalAlignment="center">
    <ThemeChangerButton />
  </Stack>
  `}
/>
