# ChildrenSlot

`ChildrenSlot` is a placeholder within a reusable component's definition to mark the location when the reusable component's children should be injected.

You can learn more about [Reusable Components](/learning/using-components/reusable-components) to understand how to use them.

## Using `ChildrenSlot`

The `MyStack` reusable component wraps children into a predefined `VStack` and displays a heading. Here, `ChildrenSlot` is nested into `VStack` to mark the location to inject `MyStack` children:

```ueml copy {4}
<Component name="MyStack">
  <H2>This is my special Stack</H2>
  <VStack padding="1rem" gap="0.2rem" backgroundColor="cyan">
   <ChildrenSlot/>
  </VStack>
</Component>
```

This sample injects children into `MyStack`:

```ueml copy {2-4}
<MyStack>
 These are the children injected into the
 <H3>MyStack</H3>
 component's ChildrenSlot placeholder
</MyStack>
```

`MyStack` puts the children into the location designated by `ChildrenSlot`:

<Playground
  previewOnly={true}
  name="Example: Using ChildrenSlot"
  horizontal={true}
  height={200}
  components={[
    `
    <Component name="MyStack">
      <H2>This is my special Stack</H2>
      <VStack padding="1rem" gap="0.2rem" backgroundColor="cyan">
       <ChildrenSlot/>
      </VStack>
    </Component>
  `,
  ]}
  app={`
    <MyStack>
     These are the children injected into the
     <H3>MyStack</H3>
     component's ChildrenSlot placeholder
    </MyStack>
  `}
/>
