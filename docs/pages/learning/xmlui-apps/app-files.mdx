# Application Files

  XMLUI apps have a simple file structure that can be directly hosted as a set of static files in a web server's folder. 
</Callout>

This folder contains an `index.html` file that loads one or more JavaScript files (the XMLUI framework and other optional component libraries). It also contains your app's XMLUI source.

When the XMLUI app starts running, the framework compiles the source files and ignites the app.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  This behavior allows you to run an XMLUI app by copying (or uploading) its files into a web server folder prepared for serving static files without a build process.
</Callout>

Your app consists of a few source files, which have the `.xmlui` (XMLUI markup files) or `xmlui.xs` (XMLUI code-behind files) extensions.

An app has a mandatory file named `Main.xmlui`. When the app's `index.html` file is served from the web server, it looks for the `Main.xmlui` file to render the app's UI.
