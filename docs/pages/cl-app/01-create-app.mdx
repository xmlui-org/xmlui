# Create The App

Download the contact list app's starter zip file from here (link placeholder) and unzip it into a working folder.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Remember, you need a local web server to run the XMLUI app. (If you do not have a web server on your machine or are unsure how to configure it, we suggest you install the [Simple Web Server](https://simplewebserver.org/download.html). It is a free tool with a graphical user interface.)
</Callout>

Start your web server using the unzipped sample folder of the contact list starter app as the root for serving static files, and visit the web server's default page in your browser.

When your app starts, it displays this page:

<br/>
<Image alt="App start" src="/resources/images/get-started/cl-start.png" />

The app is straightforward, as its single markup file, `Main.xmlui` (the entry point of an XMLUI app), shows:

```ueml copy filename="Main.xmlui"
<App>
  <AppHeader title="Contact Management" />
  <NavPanel>
    <NavLink label="Home" to="/" icon="home"/>
  </NavPanel>
  <Pages>
    <Page url="/">Home</Page>
  </Pages>
  <Footer>
    Powered by XMLUI
  </Footer>
</App>
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  The `App` component automatically **displays a logo** when the configuration file contains a logo declaration.
</Callout>

The Contact List starter app has such a definition in the `config.json` file:

```json copy filename="config.json" {5-6}
{
  "name": "Contact List Tutorial",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "resources": {
    "logo": "resources/xmlui-logo.svg",
    "logo-dark": "resources/xmlui-logo-dark.svg",
    "favicon": "resources/favicon.ico",
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
The `name` property in the configuration contains the **title the browser displays** in the app's tab.
</Callout>

## Setting Up the Scenario

The sample app works with a list of contacts stored in a database with two tables, `contacts` and `categories`. The latter one is a dictionary that associates an integer ID with a display name to describe contact categories like "Decision Maker," "Influencer," and others.

The structure of these tables is the following:

**The `contacts` table**:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | integer | The unique identifier of the contact |
| fullName | string | The contact's name |
| categoryId | integer | Reference to the category ID of the contact |
| comments | string | Additional information about the contact |
| reviewDueDate | date | The date when the contact should be reviewed |
| reviewCompleted | boolean | Indicates whether the review is completed |

**The `categories` table**:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | integer | The unique identifier of the category |
| name | string | The category's name |
| color | string | The category's color |

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Though storing something like "color" in a database may be an anti-pattern, we store category colors there for the sake of simplicity, and we use this information in this tutorial.
</Callout>

In this application, we assume that each contact's information is regularly reviewed by someone (for example, after a visit or a call). We store related data for each contact in the `reviewDueDate` and `reviewCompleted` fields. In the tutorial, you will use the information for filtering and grouping.

## Creating the App's Pages

The default app uses a horizontal layout with a single menu function, Home. The initial version of the Contact List app will contain only two information pages, one for a dashboard and another for displaying contacts. You can modify the default app structure in a few steps:

Open the `Main.xmlui` file in your editor and change its contents to the following:

```ueml copy filename="Main.xmlui" /layout="vertical-full-header"/ {3-10}
<App layout="vertical-full-header">
  <AppHeader title="Contact Management" />
  <NavPanel>
    <NavLink label="Dashboard" to="/" />
    <NavLink label="Contacts" to="/contacts" />
  </NavPanel>
  <Pages>
    <Page url="/">Dashboard</Page>
    <Page url="/contacts">Contacts</Page>
  </Pages>
  <Footer>
    Powered by XMLUI
  </Footer>
</App>
```

Refresh the browser; as a result of the changes in `Main.xmlui`, you will see a new layout of the app:

<br/>
<Image alt="Initial P2DO" src="/resources/images/get-started/cl-initial.png" />

The `App` component represents the entire app. It provides several layout placeholders (such as a header, a footer, a navigation panel, etc.) that you can fill with content. Its `layout` property determines how the placeholders are combined into a working app; this value determines the layout and some subtle app behavior details.

- The `vertical-full-header` layout docks the app header to the top and the footer to the bottom. The navigation panel and the main content share the remaining area.
- The `AppHeader` placeholder defines the app's header (title) to display. In the header, you see a logo from the app's resources.
- XMLUI uses URLs for in-app navigation. The two `NavLink` components within `NavPanel` declare the app's simple menu structure. Each `NavLink` has a `to` property with the corresponding target URL.
- The `NavLink` counterpart is the two `Page` components within `Pages`. They describe the "page" that will load when a particular menu item is selected. In this phase, these pages just display their names.

## Using an Emulated Backend

The app will use a backend to retrieve and store data. XMLUI provides a powerful tool, the API emulator, as part of the framework, which provides an in-browser backend.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Creating an emulated backend is not very complex but requires a different experience than leveraging web API endpoints. We provided this emulation with the contact list app for you; you just use it.
</Callout>

Test the emulated backend by adding code that triggers invoking an endpoint. Replace the `Page` tag with the `/contacts` URL with this one:

```ueml copy {3-4} filename="Main.xmlui"
<!-- Omitted -->
<Page url="/tasks">
  <Datasource id="categories" url="/api/categories" />
  <Text variant="codefence">{JSON.stringify(categories.value, null, 2)}</Text>
</Page>
<!-- Omitted -->
```

Turn to the app running in the browser and refresh. Click the "Contact List" menu item; it will trigger fetching the "category" data from the backend and display it on the screen in JSON:

<br/>
<Image alt="Test API" src="/resources/images/get-started/test-emulated-api.png" />

The highlighted markup lines access the `/categories` API endpoint, which retrieves a list of contact categories. The `Text` component converts the list to JSON and displays it.

In the following article, you will learn how the `Datasource` component works together with others to fetch and leverage data from a backend.
