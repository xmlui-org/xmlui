# Getting Started

This section will help you get your hands dirty and experiment with XMLUI by discovering and creating a few apps.

You need only a **few steps** to play with them!
</Callout>

1. Download the particular sample.
2. Unzip the sample (each is a zipped file) into a working folder.
3. Run your locally installed web server using the sample's working folder as the root of serving static files.
4. Run your browser and visit the web server's default page.

If you do not have a web server on your machine or are unsure how to configure it, **we suggest you install the Simple Web Server**. It is a free tool with a graphical user interface. Visit this page to download it: https://simplewebserver.org/download.html

After the installation, you can easily set up a new web server by selecting your preferred port number and the host directory. When using it with XMLUI, set the host directory to your XMLUI app's folder.

If you prefer using Node (and have it already installed on your machine), you can create the starter app with the command line using the `npx` utility and the `create-xmlui-app` tool. Find more details in another article [here](tools/create-xmlui-app/).
