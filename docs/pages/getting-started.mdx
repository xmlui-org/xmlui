# Getting Started

This section will help you grasp the main concepts of XMLUI. Start by experimenting with this intuitive UI framework by creating a few apps.

You can quickly get your hands dirty by trying to write an app with XMLUI. There are two ways to get a flying start:

1. You can use a web server on your machine and download the starter samples in this section. These samples contain the XMLUI source code and a few other files to allow your app to be hosted on the web server. This article will introduce this approach.

2. If you prefer using Node (and have it already installed on your machine), you can create the starter app with the command line using the `npx` utility and the `create-xmlui-app` tool. Find more details in another article [here](tools/create-xmlui-app/).

Choose the option that best fits your development style. While getting acquainted with XMLUI, the first option is more straightforward: it does not require time-consuming installation or configuration; a single code editor is enough to create apps.

The first approach makes app deployment straightforward. You grab the XMLUI folder and put it directly into a production web server. However, such an XMLUI app requires a few seconds to start up.

The second option offers a development environment with hot module reloading, which you may prefer to the previous one. When your app is ready for distribution, running a command will create the folder structure to host on a production web server. This build optimizes your app, so startup is much faster.

## Using XMLUI with a development web server

XMLUI samples and applications are available as static files and are immediately ready to be hosted by a web server. Most samples are zipped files with a particular file structure; each file and folder has its specific role. When you download our [starter sample](#) (URL to be set later), the unzipped folder has this structure:

```
<XMLUI app folder>
  ├── index.html (The web page that opens in the browser)
  ├── Main.xmlui (The main XMLUI file with the app)
  ├── config.json (The app's configuration file)
  ├── components (The folder with the app's XMLUI components)
  │   ├── ApiAware.xmlui
  │   ├── Home.xmlui
  │   ├── IncButton.xmlui
  │   ├── PagePanel.xmlui
  └── resources (Static app resources like images, logos, icons, etc.)
      ├── favicon.ico
      ├── xmlui-logo.svg
      └── xmlui-logo-inverted.svg
```

The files with the `.xmlui` extension (and, as you will learn later, with the `.xmlui.xs` extension) are XMLUI source files. When you modify any of them and refresh the browser, the engine immediately compiles them and updates the page accordingly.

The hosted web page loads a single JavaScript file with the XMLUI engine. When loaded, this file processes the source files and turns them into a working app.

```html file=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/xmlui@0.4.2-beta.1/dist/xmlui-standalone.umd.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

## Installing a web server on your machine

You can use your preferred web server on your machine. Nonetheless, if you have no idea which one to use, here are a few suggestions.

### Simple Web Server (any platform)

The Simple Web Server is a free tool with a graphical user interface. Visit this page to download it: https://simplewebserver.org/download.html

After the installation, you can easily set up a new web server by selecting your preferred port number and the host directory. When using it with XMLUI, set the host directory to your XMLUI app's folder.

### Using a python3 web server on MacOS

Newer MacOS versions ship with python3 installed. If your operating system has not been updated for a long time, you may need to install it; you will quickly find appropriate instructions by searching for the "install python3 macosx" web search.

To run an XMLUI app, select the app's root folder and start `http-server` with these commands:

```
cd <the path to the XMLUI app>
python3 -m http.server 8080 --bind localhost 
```

This command line will start the Python-hosted web server on port 8080. You can change the port by specifying a different number. The running web server displays the available host URLs; choose one and open it in the browser.
 
 ### Using the `http-server` NPM package (any platform)

If you have Node already installed on your machine, adding a web server is a low-hanging fruit. The `http-server` NPM package works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and does not need any configuration; it just works.

To run an XMLUI app, select the app's root folder and start `http-server` with these commands:

```
cd <the path to the XMLUI app>
npx http-server 
```

The `npx` utility checks if your machine has cached the `http-server`. If not, it will be installed after you confirm. Then, the web server starts serving static file contents from the current folder; it will run the XMLUI app. The web server will list a few URLs. Choose your preferred one and open it in the browser to display the running app.
> **Note**: If you want to use a different port from the default one, use the -p option to specify that port like in this sample:
> ```
> npx http-server -p 5173
> ```
