# Getting Started with XMLUI

XMLUI is a declarative UI framework with a simple markup allowing you to create web apps directly bound to web APIs on the backend.

>[!INFO]
> - XMLUI applications have a **simple structure**. You can copy the app files into your web server's static files folder, and they are ready to be hosted instantly.
> - In contrast to other UI frameworks, XMLUI offers **simple concepts** to create apps quickly **without coping with the cumbersome peculiarities of web development**.
> - It integrates with **web APIs** out of the box.
> - You can create **reusable app components** to avoid markup repetition and improve maintainability.
> - You can change an app's visual appearance by selecting a **built-in theme or creating or deriving a new one**.

After trying our Starter App, visit the [Dive Deeper](#dive-deeper) section of this article for suggestions on further steps to get acquainted with XMLUI.

## Try the Starter App

We have a starter app you can use to get acquainted with XMLUI. Download its zip file from <DownloadLink href={GETTING_STARTED}>here</DownloadLink> and unzip it into a working folder.

You need only a couple of things to try it:
- Your favorite text (code) editor.
- A local web server to run the XMLUI app. 

Install the LTS version of Node.js on your machine (https://nodejs.org/en). Then, you will use the HTTP Node package to host the tutorial.

Open a command line prompt and select the unzipped sample folder as your working folder (you must find `index.html` in the working folder). Type this command line to start the web server and open your default browser with the app:

```bash copy
npx -y http-server -o
```

When your app starts, it displays this page:

<Image alt="App start" src="/resources/images/get-started/app-start.png" />

>[!INFO]
> Later, when you modify the code, refresh the browser page to reload the page with the changes. In some cases, depending on your settings, the browser caches the page, so the refresh will not respond to your markup changes. If you experience this, the browser caching may be turned on; turn it off.

> Check your browser's documentation for details. If you use Chrome, turn on Developer Tools (F12), go to the Network tab, and set the "Disable cache" checkbox.

You can try some simple and cool XMLUI features with the menu items.

In the following sections, you will change and extend the app. During these slight changes, you will also learn some simple XMLUI concepts.

## Modify the Displayed Text

The sample's root folder contains a `Main.xmlui` file, which is the app's entry point. Open this file in your code editor. Scroll down to the bottom of this file and modify the `<Footer>` element's content by changing the "Powered by XMLUI" text to something else:

```xmlui copy /I modified it!!!/ filename="Main.xmlui"
<App 
  name="Tutorial"
  logo="resources/xmlui-logo.svg"
  logo-dark="resources/xmlui-logo-dark.svg">
  <AppHeader>
    <!-- ... -->
  </AppHeader>
  <NavPanel>
    <!-- ... -->
  </NavPanel>
  <Pages>
    <!-- ... -->
  </Pages>  
  <Footer>
    Powered by XMLUI -- I modified it!!!
  </Footer>
</App>
```

Save the `Main.xmlui` file and refresh the app's page in the browser. The app now displays the modified footer.

<Image alt="App modified" src="/resources/images/get-started/app-modified.png" />

>[!INFO]
> Each tag (`<App>`, `<AppHeader>`, `<NavPanel>`, `<Pages>`, `<Footer>`, and the others) in the markup represents a **component**. Components are the basic building blocks of XMLUI apps. You can **nest them** to represent the hierarchy of UI elements.

(Later, when we refer to a component, we omit the wrapping angle brackets and use only the name.)

## Modify a List's Display

When you click the "SpaceX List" menu item, the app displays a list with data fetched from the SpaceX API.

<Image alt="App modified" src="/resources/images/get-started/spacex-list.png" />

The SpaceX API endpoint in this sample retrieves other data fields, including links. After observing the markup, you will modify the UI to display those links and allow navigating to their targets.

This functionality is a cooperation of a couple of components within `App`: `NavLink`, and `Page`:

```xmlui filename="Main.xmlui" {6,10-14} /NavLink/ /Page/
<App 
  name="Tutorial"
  logo="resources/xmlui-logo.svg"
  logo-dark="resources/xmlui-logo-dark.svg">
  <NavPanel>
    <NavLink label="SpaceX List" to="/spacexlist" />
    <!-- Other menu items omitted -->
  </NavPanel>
  <Pages>
    <Page url="/spacexlist">
      <List data="https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/history">
        <Card title="{$item.title}" subtitle="{$item.details}" />
      </List>
    </Page>
    <!-- Other Page items omitted -->
  </Pages>
  <!-- Other components omitted -->
</App>
```

>[!INFO]
> Components have **properties** that determine their appearance and behavior. Properties are declared as XML attributes when they can be represented with strings.

Components work together declaratively. `App` connects the `to` property of `NavLink` with the `url` property of `Page`. As a result, the particular page is displayed when you click the "SpaceX List" menu item.

### Components with Children

`List` is a component that works with data items and renders them into a scrollable list. You can define the UI for a particular item with its nested children. 

```xmlui copy {2} filename="Main.xmlui" /data/
<List data="https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/history">
  <Card title="{$item.title}" subtitle="{$item.details}" />
</List>
```

>[!INFO]
> You can use **expressions** in property values. Expressions are wrapped in curly braces.

The `title` and `subtitle` property values of `Card` are expressions, `{$item.title}` and `{$item.details}`, respectively.

>[!INFO]
> The component definitions within the template properties can access information in the hosting component (the one using the template's content) through identifiers starting with `$`. We call them **context values**.

The list uses a `Card` component to display a particular item. `Card` has a `title` and a `subtitle` property to display two data entries. The `$item` context value represents the current item of the list to be displayed. So, `$item.title` and `$item.details` represent the current item's `title` and `details` fields in the fetched data list.

### Fetching Data from API Endpoints

The specific endpoint of the SpaceX API (given in the `data` property of `List`) retrieves a list of event history items. A single item has this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "<Record ID>",
  "title": "<Short title>",
  "event_date_utc": "<Event date>",
  "event_date_unix": "<Event date in Unix format>",
  "details": "<Event details>",
  "links": {
    "reddit": "<Reddit URL>",
    "article": "<Article URL>",
    "wikipedia": "<Wikipedia URL>"
  }
}
```

>[!INFO]
> Components working with data **can be bound to API endpoints** as well.
  Many XMLUI components handle data fetching from an API (using GET) in the `data` property.

### Updating the Item Template

Change the `Card` component to display the SpaceX and Wikipedia links and allow the user to navigate to them:

```xmlui copy {2-3} filename="Main.xmlui"
<Card title="{$item.title}" subtitle="{$item.details}">
  <Link to="{$item.links.article}" target="_blank">SpaceX</Link>
  <Link to="{$item.links.wikipedia}" target="_blank">Wikipedia</Link>
</Card>
```

When you refresh the app in the browser, it will display the links. Click a link to open it in a new browser tab.

<Image alt="App modified" src="/resources/images/get-started/spacex-list-with-links.png" />

## Extend the App

>[!INFO]
> You can **easily extend** an XMLUI working app.

In this section, you will add a new component to your app's page to display three boxes. Their markup is similar; however, each has its particular color and text.

### Define a Reusable Component

Create a new file in the `components` folder named `MyBox.xmlui`, and copy this contents to it:

```xmlui copy filename="components/MyBox.xmlui"
<Component name="MyBox">
  <Stack 
    padding="$padding-normal"
    borderColor="{$props.color}"
    borderWidth="8px">
    {$props.label}
  </Stack>
</Component>
```

### Use the Reusable Component

This code declares a reusable component named `MyBox` with two properties, `color` and `title`. You add a page displaying three instances of `MyBox` to the menu with a few steps:

1. Open the `Main.xmlui` file and navigate to the `<NavPanel>` section. It contains several `<NavLink>` child items, each representing a menu item that can navigate to its corresponding UI page. Append a new one:

```xmlui copy {5}
<!-- ... -->
  <NavPanel>
    <NavLink label="Home" to="/" icon="home"/>
    <NavLink label="SpaceX List" to="/spacexlist" />
    <NavLink label="My Boxes" to="/myboxes" />
  </NavPanel>
<!-- ... -->
```

2. Scroll down to the `<Pages>` section, which contains `<Page>` items. These items declare how the UI belonging to a particular navigation link should display.
3. Append a new `<Page>` item to the bottom of the `<Pages>` section:

```xmlui copy {5-7}
  <Pages>
    <!-- Previous <Page> tags omitted -->
    <Page url="/myboxes">
      <HStack>
        <MyBox color="red" label="Red box" />
        <MyBox color="green" label="My green box" />
        <MyBox color="blue" label="Our blue box" />
      </HStack>
    </Page>
  </Pages>
```

Return to the browser and refresh the current page. Click the "My Boxes" item in the menu. You will see the newly added component works:

<Image alt="App modified" src="/resources/images/get-started/app-with-boxes.png" />

### Respond to an Event

>[!INFO]
> Components handle **user and system events**. You can declare **event handlers** to change how components respond to particular events. Handling events may change some components' properties. XMLUI observes these changes and refreshes the UI accordingly.

Extend the `MyBox` component to display a toast when the box is clicked.

```xmlui copy filename="components/MyBox.xmlui" /onClick/ {6}
<Component name="MyBox">
  <Stack 
    padding="$padding-normal"
    borderColor="{$props.color}"
    borderWidth="8px"
    onClick="toast('You clicked ' + $props.label)">
    {$props.label}
  </Stack>
</Component>
```

You can add event handlers to a component using an attribute with the `on` prefix followed by the event name (camel-casing). The attribute value is the script for the event handler code.

In the code above, the `onClick` attribute is added to the `Stack` component. When the user clicks the stack, the `toast` function is called with a message.

The code above executes the `toast('You clicked' + $props.label)` event handler, which displays a notification in the app's top-right corner.

When you refresh the app in the browser and click a box, a toast will appear:

<Image alt="App modified" src="/resources/images/get-started/app-with-toast.png" />
