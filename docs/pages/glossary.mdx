# Glossary of Terms

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **Markup** | The **XMLUI markup** is the language used to define the structure and layout of an application. It uses tags to represent components and attributes to configure their properties, allowing developers to design and customize user interfaces.|
| **Scripting language** | The **scripting language of XMLUI** is a lightweight subset of JavaScript used to implement specific UI logic. Scripts are required sparingly, primarily for customizing the default interaction between components. They can be written inline within markup or placed in code-behind files for better organization. |
| **Component** | A **component** is a fundamental building block of the XMLUI system, **represented by a tag in the markup**. The framework includes built-in components, and it can also be extended with third-party components or app-specific components created by users. |
| **Component ID** | A component ID is **an optional identifier** defined using the id markup attribute (and follows the scripting identifier syntax). It allows you to access the component's exposed properties and methods directly. |
| **Component Presence** | If the optional `when` property is set to `true` (the default), the component in the markup tree is rendered. Otherwise, the engine treats the component as if omitted from the markup. |
| **Property** | An XMLUI component **property** defines a component's appearance, behavior, or functionality. It is typically set as an attribute in the markup but can also be defined using helper tags in some cases. |
| **Template property** | A template property in XMLUI is a component property whose value is a component definition. It allows you to specify how certain parts of a component, such as list items, should be displayed or rendered. You can declare its value using the `<property>` helper tag. |
| **Inline Expression** | An inline expression is a dynamically evaluated snippet of code that can be used in properties (markup attributes) or text elements. It is wrapped in curly braces (`{` and `}`) and follows the scripting expression syntax defined by the framework.
| **String interpolation** | This mechanism allows you to **mix multiple literal string segments with inline expressions** in attributes and text elements. The expressions are dynamically evaluated, and their values are combined with the literal string segments to produce the final result. |
| **Event handler** | An **event handler** in XMLUI responds to user or system events. While components handle events by default, custom event handlers can be added for particular app logic. Event handlers are typically defined as attributes with an `on` prefix followed by the event name or using the `<event>` helper tag in the markup. |
| **Variable** | XMLUI variables stores state, similar to variables in programming languages. However, unlike most programming languages, XMLUI variables are reactive: they automatically update when their dependencies change, such as components or other variables they rely on. This ensures the UI re-evaluates and reflects the updated state without requiring additional scripting. |
| **Code-behind file** | This optional file is associated with an XMLUI component that contains scripting logic separate from the markup. It defines event handlers, custom methods, variables, and other UI logic to keep the markup clean and organized. |
| **Exposed Properties and Methods** | A component may have exposed methods and properties that **allow you to query its state or initiate actions**. For example, you can set a textbox's value from an event handler, refresh data from the backend, or check if a particular backend query is in progress. |
| **Component Binding** | **Component binding** in XMLUI allows components to interact by using properties with inline scripting expressions. For example, you can bind a textbox to another component to dynamically display the text being typed in real-time. |
| **Context value** | A context value is an **internal, read-only property** associated with a specific component context, which is usually a template property or an event handler. It is represented by an identifier that starts with a dollar sign (`$`). For example, `$item` in a `List` component's item template represents the data of the iteration item being rendered. |
| **Data Binding** | This mechanism **fetches data from backend API endpoints** and makes it available to components. In most cases, you only need to provide a URL, and the framework handles the rest, ensuring the data is readily accessible. |
| **Data Change Detection** | XMLUI automatically **tracks changes to data** in the UI and refreshes affected parts of the interface. For example, if you add a new item to a list via a dialog, the list will be refreshed after the operation to display the updated data without requiring manual intervention or scripting. |
| **Reusable Components** | The framework allows declaring reusable components **using XMLUI markup and scripts, without requiring JavaScript**. These components can be used within the application or shared as third-party components. |
| **Theme** | An XMLUI theme is a coherent set of application-wide and component-specific style settings that define the overall visual appearance of an app. Themes can be dynamically changed while the app is running. It is easy to create a new theme by inheriting from an existing one and overriding only the modified settings. |
| **Theme variable** | A theme variable is a **single setting within a theme definition**. Changing the value of a theme variable causes all components that use it to automatically refresh their UI. Some theme variables are app-bound, setting global app-wide style settings, while others are specific to particular components. |
| **Resources** | Resources in XMLUI are **external assets**, such as icons, images, fonts, and more, that can be defined and referenced within the application, typically through a URL. Such assets **can also be declared within a theme**. |
| **Layout Property** | Layout properties define **specific visual traits of a component**, such as text color, padding, shadows, font style, border rounding, and more. These properties **can have literal values**, like "red" for text color or "20px" for padding. Alternatively, they **can derive their values from theme variables** for consistent styling across the application. |
