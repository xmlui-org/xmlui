# BarChart

The `BarChart` component represents a bar chart.

## Context Variables

This component does not have any context variables.

## Props

### `data`

This property is used to provide the component with data to display.
The data itself needs to be an array of objects.

NOTE: This does not seem to work, produces errors:

<Playground
  previewOnly
  name="Example: data"
  height={300}
  app={`
    <App>
      <BarChart
        data="{[ { stage: 'Prospecting', value: 231 } ]}"
      />
    </App>
  `}
/>
