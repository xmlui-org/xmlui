# Accordion

(**NOT IMPLEMENTED YET**) The `Accordion` component is a collapsible container that toggles the display of content sections. It helps organize information by expanding or collapsing it based on user interaction.

## Context Variables

This component does not have any context variables.

## Properties

### `collapsedIcon`

This property is the name of the icon that is displayed when the accordion is collapsed.

### `expandedIcon`

This property is the name of the icon that is displayed when the accordion is expanded.

### `header`

This property declares the text used in the component's header.

### `headerTemplate`

This property describes the template to use as the component's header.

### `hideIcon`

This property indicates that the trigger icon is not displayed (`true`).

### `initiallyExpanded`

This property indicates if the Accordion is expanded (`true`) or collapsed (`false`).

### `positionInGroup`

This property indicates the position of the accordion in a group of accordions.

The possible values are:

| Value    | Description                                                              |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `single` | The accordion stands alone (not in a group)                              |
| `first`  | This accordion is the first in a group                                   |
| `middle` | This accordion is between the first and last items in an accordion group |
| `last`   | This accordion is the last in a group                                    |

By default, this value is `single`.

### `rotateExpanded`

This optional property defines the rotation angle of the expanded icon (relative to the collapsed icon).

If this property has a value, only the collapsed icon is used. When the accordion is expanded, the collapsed icon is rotated with this angle.

### `triggerPosition`

This property indicates the position where the trigger icon should be displayed. The `start` value signs the trigger is before the header text (template), and `end` indicates that it follows the header.

## API

This component does not provide any API.

## Events

### `displayDidChange`

This event is triggered when value of Accordion has changed.

## Styling

This component does not have any styles.
