In this inaugural post we'll explore the simple blog engine created for this series of posts. Our tagline is *Practical User Interfaces Built Simply*  and creating this blog couldn't have been simpler. This site is an XMLUI app built with [NavPanel](/components/NavPanel), [NavLink](/components/NavLink), [Pages](/components/Pages), [Page](/components/Page), and [Markdown](/components/Markdown). I didn't need to reinvent any wheels to create this the first working version.


```xmlui-pg name="XMLUI blog v1"
---app
<App
    layout="vertical"
    var.blogTitles="{{
    'blog1': 'The first XMLUI blog post',
    'blog2': 'The second post'
    }}"
 >
  <NavPanel>
    <NavGroup label="Blog">
      <NavLink label="{blogTitles.blog1}" to="/blog-1" />
      <NavLink label="{blogTitles.blog2}" to="/blog-2" />
    </NavGroup>
  </NavPanel>
    <Pages>
      <Page url="/blog-1">
        <BlogPage
          content="This is the first post"
          title="{blogTitles.blog1}"
          author="Jon Udell"
          date="2025-08-29" />
      </Page>
      <Page url="/blog-2">
        <BlogPage
          content="This is the second post"
          title="{blogTitles.blog2}"
          author="Istvan Novak"
          date="2025-09-01" />
      </Page>
    </Pages>
</App>
---comp
<Component name="BlogPage">
  <VStack width="{$props.width ? $props.width : '85%'}">
    <VStack>
      <H1>{$props.title}</H1>
      <HStack gap="$space-2">
        <Text>{$props.date}</Text>
        <Text>-</Text>
        <Text>{$props.author}</Text>
      </HStack>
    </VStack>
    <Markdown
      content="{$props.content}"
      data="{$props.url}" />
    <Slot />
  </VStack>
</Component>
```

You can use it here or you can jump out to a playground and make live changes. [Watch](/tbd).

This is a pretty good start! We can write posts in Markdown, arrange them in reverse chronological order, and hey, it's the essence of a blog. Since it's a blog about XMLUI the live playground is a nice bonus that any XMLUI app might put to good use. The user interfaces that you build with XMLUI will require some explaining, it's handy to explain with working examples as well as images, text, and video.

Let's unpack how this works, there isn't much to it.

## Declare the App

The `App` declared in `Main.xmlui` sets up metadata and navigation:

```xmlui
<App
    var.blogTitles="{{
    'blog1': 'The first XMLUI blog post',
    'blog2': 'The second post'
    }}"
>
  <NavPanel>
    <NavGroup label="Blog">
      <NavLink label="{blogTitles.blog1}" to="/blog-1" />
      <NavLink label="{blogTitles.blog2}" to="/blog-2" />
    </NavGroup>
  </NavPanel>
  <!-- Pages section... -->
</App>
```


## Declare Pages

Each Page contains a [user-defined component](https://docs.xmlui.org/user-defined-components). The published site you are reading sends Markdown text to that component with the `url=` declaration.

```xmlui {5}
<Pages>
  ...
  <Page url="/blog-1">
    <BlogPage
      url="/blog/1.md"
      title="{blogTitles.blog1}"
      author="Jon Udell"
      date="2025-08-30" />
  </Page>
  ...
</Pages>
```

The prototype in the playground works even more simply by just sending string using `content=`.

```xmlui {3}
<Page url="/blog-1">
  <BlogPage
    content="This is the first post"
    title="{blogTitles.blog1}"
    author="Jon Udell"
    date="2025-08-29" />
</Page>
```

The underlying [Markdown](/components/Markdown) component works with either flavor.

## Render Pages

Here's how `BlogPage` assembles data and metadata to create a post like the one you are reading.

```xmlui
<Component name="BlogPage">
  <VStack width="85%">
    <VStack>
      <H1>{$props.title}</H1>
      <HStack gap="$space-2">
        <Text>{$props.date}</Text>
        <Text> - </Text>
        <Text>{$props.author}</Text>
      </HStack>
    </VStack>
    <Markdown
      data="{$props.url}" />
    <Slot />
  </VStack>
</Component>
```

The `url` property for this post is `blog/1.md`.

## Publish

To speed things up and help search engines do their thing, the XMLUI app that serves this site is built on an [open source foundation](https://github.com/xmlui-org/xmlui) that includes machinery to render pages statically. We'll cover that another time. For now, to show how minimal things can be, we'll put the prototype into an Amazon S3 bucket and evolve it there in phases
