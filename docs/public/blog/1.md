In this inaugural post we'll explore the blog engine that I just created, in about 30 minutes, to enable this and future posts.  Our tagline is *Practical User Interfaces Built Simply*  and creating this blog couldn't have been simpler. This site is an XMLUI app build with components including [NavPanel](/components/NavPanel), [NavLink](/components/NavLink), [Pages](/components/Pages), [Page](/components/Page), and [Markdown](/components/Markdown). I didn't need to reinvent any wheels to create the blog. Here were the steps.

## Add navigation

An XMLUI app starts by loading an `index.html` but the action really starts with an [App](/components/App) defined in `Main.xmlui`. I added these two chunks to the existing `Main.xmlui`. Here's the new section in the sidebar where we'll accumulate post links and titles.

```
<NavGroup label="Blog">
    <NavLink label="{blog1}" to="/blog-1" />
</NavGroup>
```

Here's where we'll define the sidebar links.


```xmlui
<Pages>
  ...
    <Page url="/blog-1">
        <BlogPage
            url="/blog/1.md"
            title="{blog1}"
            author="Jon Udell"
            date="2025-08-29" />
    </Page>
  ...
</Pages>
```

The user-defined `<BlogPage>` didn't exist yet, nor did the `App` variable `{blog1}`. This was just a sketch of what the structure would be.
