# Glossary of Terms

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **Markup** | The **XMLUI markup** is the language used to define the structure and layout of an application. |
| **Scripting language** | The **scripting language of XMLUI** is a lightweight subset of JavaScript used to implement specific UI logic. |
| **Component** | A **component** is a fundamental building block of the XMLUI system, **represented by a tag in the markup**.  |
| **Component ID** | A component ID is **an optional identifier** defined using the `id` markup attribute. It allows you to access the component's exposed properties and methods directly. |
| **Property** | An XMLUI component **property** defines a component's appearance, behavior, or functionality. |
| **Template property** | A template property in XMLUI is a component property whose **value is a component definition**. You can declare its value using the `<property>` helper tag. |
| **Inline Expression** | An inline expression is a dynamically evaluated snippet of code that can be used in properties (markup attributes) or text elements. It is wrapped in curly braces (`{` and `}`).
| **String interpolation** | This mechanism allows you to **mix multiple literal string segments with inline expressions** in attributes and text elements. |
| **Event handler** | An **event handler** in XMLUI responds to user or system events. You can change the component's default behavior by declaring an event handler. |
| **Variable** | XMLUI variables store state like programming language variables, but they are reactive and automatically update when their dependencies change. |
| **Code-behind file** | This optional file is associated with an XMLUI component that contains scripting logic separate from the markup. |
| **Exposed Properties and Methods** | A component may have exposed methods and properties that **allow you to query its state or initiate actions**. |
| **Component Binding** | **Component binding** in XMLUI allows components to interact by using properties with inline scripting expressions. |
| **Context value** | A context value is an **internal, read-only property** associated with a specific component context, which is usually a template property or an event handler. |
| **Data Binding** | This mechanism **fetches data from backend API endpoints** and makes it available to components. In most cases, you only need to provide a URL, and the framework handles the rest, ensuring the data is readily accessible. |
| **Data Change Detection** | XMLUI automatically tracks data changes and refreshes affected parts of the UI. |
| **Reusable Components** | The framework allows declaring reusable components **using XMLUI markup and scripts, without requiring JavaScript**. These components can be used within the application or shared as third-party components. |
| **Theme** | An XMLUI theme is a coherent set of application-wide and component-specific style settings that define the overall visual appearance of an app. |
| **Theme variable** | A theme variable is a **single setting within a theme definition**. Changing the value of a theme variable causes all components that use it to automatically refresh their UI. |
| **Resources** | Resources in XMLUI are **external assets**, such as icons, images, fonts, and more, that can be defined and referenced within the application, typically through a URL. |
| **Layout Property** | Layout properties define **specific visual traits of a component**, such as text color, padding, shadows, font style, border rounding, and more. |
