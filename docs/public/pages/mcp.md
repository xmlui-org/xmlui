# xmlui-mcp: Model Context Protocol server for XMLUI (experimental)

The Model Context Procotol (MCP) enables AI agents to use third-party tools. If you are using an agent like Claude or Cursor, you can equip them with a set of XMLUI-specific tools so they can:

- list available XMLUI components
- review documentation for a component
- search XMLUI source code
- search XMLUI apps
- help you build your own XMLUI app

An experimental xmlui-mcp tookit is available [here](https://github.com/xmlui-org/xmlui-mcp). To use it, clone that repo and also the [XMLUI repo](https://github.com/xmlui-org/xmlui) to create this layout.

```xmlui-tree
<root>
  xmlui
  xmlui-mcp
```

This is an example of a conversation with Claude in which it uses some of the xmlui-mcp tools.
