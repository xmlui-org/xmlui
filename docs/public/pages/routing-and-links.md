# Routing and Links

XMLUI implements client-side routing with URLs bound to UI views. You can use two different  routing mechanisms: *hash* and *standard*. Both store the current location in the browser's address bar and work with the browser's history stack. However, they differ in the URLs they send to the backend server.

## Hash routing (default)

If you don't have complete control over the server, you may not be able to configure it to retrieve the `index.html` file as a single-page app requires. Hash routing solves this issue. If your app is hosted at the `myComp.com/accountapp` URL (this URL serves the default `index.html` file from the server), navigation URLs will look like `myComp.com/accountapp/#/leads/12` or `myComp.com/accountapp/#/list?zip=98005`. Even multiple hash marks may show up (for example, if you navigate to a bookmark: `myComp.com/accountapp/#/leads/12#callhistory`).

The server receives only the part of the URL (`myComp.com/accountapp`) that precedes the hash mark. The client-side routing mechanism uses the remainder to navigate within the app.

You can turn off hash routing and switch to standard routing using the app's `config.json` file.

```json
{
  "name": "MyHashRoutedApp",
  "appGlobals": {
    "useHashBasedRouting": false
  }
};
```

## Standard routing (optional)

When you navigate to an URL (e.g., refresh the current page), the browser sends the entire path to the web server. XMLUI apps are single-page web apps, and your web server should be configured accordingly.

For example, if your app is hosted at the `myComp.com/accountapp` URL (this URL serves the default `index.html` file from the server), it should be configured to retrieve the same `index.html` file even if the browser-sent URL contains path or query segments, such as ;`myComp.com/accountapp/leads/12` or `myComp.com/accountapp/list?zip=98005`

If your web server is not configured this way, you'll receive 404 errors for the latest two (and similar) requests when refreshing the current page. Here's a sample `nginx` configuration.

``` copy {10}
events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    sendfile      on;

    server {
        root /path/to/your/project;

        index index.html index.htm;

        location ~ \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|json|woff|woff2|ttf|eot|svg|xs|xmlui)$ {
            add_header Cache-Control "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate, max-age=0";
            expires off;
            try_files $uri =404;
        }

        location / {
        add_header Cache-Control "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate, max-age=0";
        expires off;
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
        }
    }
}
```


## Links

XMLUI uses the specified links as absolute links (starting with a slash) or relative links, as the following example shows:

```xmlui-pg display
<App layout="vertical">
  <NavPanel>
    <NavLink to="/">Home</NavLink>
    <NavLink to="/contacts">Contacts</NavLink>
    <NavLink to="about">About</NavLink>
  </NavPanel>
  <Pages>
    <Page url="/">
      Home
    </Page>
    <Page url="contacts">
      Contacts
    </Page>
    <Page url="about">
      About
    </Page>
  </Pages>
</App>
```

Here, `/` and `/contacts` are absolute links within the app, `about` is a relative link. As then `NavPanel` hierarchy is at the root level within the app, `/contacts` and `contacts` is the same URL.

You can test it running the app; the `/contacts` link will match the related `Page` object's `contact` URL:

## Dynamic route segments

You can use parameter placeholders in the URLs as part of the route. These placeholders start with a colon and are followed by a valid identifier. In the target, you can query the value of these placeholders through the `$routeParams` context variable.

```xmlui-pg display
<App layout="vertical">
  <NavPanel>
    <NavLink to="/">Home</NavLink>
    <NavLink to="/account/Cameron">Cameron</NavLink>
    <NavLink to="/account/Joe">Joe</NavLink>
    <NavLink to="/account/Kathy">Kathy</NavLink>
  </NavPanel>
  <Pages>
    <Page url="/">
      Home
    </Page>
    <Page url="/account/:id">
      Account: {$routeParams.id}
    </Page>
  </Pages>
</App>
```


## Using query parameters

Besides rout parameters, XMLUI supports using query parameters with routes, as the following example demonstrates:

```xmlui copy /{$queryParams.from}-{$queryParams.to}/
<App layout="vertical">
  <NavPanel>
    <NavLink to="/">Home</NavLink>
    <NavLink to="/contacts">Contacts</NavLink>
    <NavLink to="/report?from=December&to=February">Winter Report</NavLink>
  </NavPanel>
  <Pages>
    <Page url="/">
      Home
    </Page>
    <Page url="contacts">
      Contacts
    </Page>
    <Page url="/report">
      Reported period: {$queryParams.from}-{$queryParams.to}
    </Page>
  </Pages>
</App>
```

The third link uses two query parameters, "from" and "to". The target page uses the `$queryParams` context variable to access them (try clicking the "Winter Report" link):

<Playground
  height={200}
  name="Example: query parameters"
  app={`
    <App layout="vertical">
      <NavPanel>
        <NavLink to="/">Home</NavLink>
        <NavLink to="/contacts">Contacts</NavLink>
        <NavLink to="/report?from=December&to=February">Winter Report</NavLink>
      </NavPanel>
      <Pages>
        <Page url="/">
          Home
        </Page>
        <Page url="contacts">
          Contacts
        </Page>
        <Page url="/report">
          Reported period: {$queryParams.from}-{$queryParams.to}
        </Page>
      </Pages>
    </App>
  `}
/>

## Active links

When the app visits a particular target in its available routes, the `NavLink` component matching with the visited route is marked as active, and it gets a visual indication (a blueish left border), like in this example:

```xmlui copy
<App layout="vertical">
  <NavPanel>
    <NavLink to="/">Home</NavLink>
    <NavLink to="/about">About</NavLink>
  </NavPanel>
  <Pages>
    <Page url="/">
      Home
    </Page>
    <Page url="/about">
      About this app
    </Page>
  </Pages>
</App>
```

When you start the app, the route is "/" (by default) and matches the Home page's route specification. Thus, Home is marked as the active link. When you click About, the route changes to "/about," so the active link becomes About (its route specification matches the current route):

<Playground
  height={120}
  name="Example: active links"
  app={`
    <App layout="vertical">
      <NavPanel>
        <NavLink to="/">Home</NavLink>
        <NavLink to="/about">About</NavLink>
      </NavPanel>
      <Pages>
        <Page url="/">
          Home
        </Page>
        <Page url="/about">
          About this app
        </Page>
      </Pages>
    </App>
  `}
/>

As a `NavLink` activity is based on matching, multiple active links may exist simultaneously. The following example demonstrates such a situation:

```xmlui copy {4-5}
<App layout="vertical">
  <NavPanel>
    <NavLink to="/">Home</NavLink>
    <NavLink to="/report?from=December&to=February">Winter Report</NavLink>
    <NavLink to="/report?from=June&to=August">Summer Report</NavLink>
  </NavPanel>
  <Pages>
    <Page url="/">
      Home
    </Page>
    <Page url="/report">
      Reported period: {$queryParams.from}-{$queryParams.to}
    </Page>
  </Pages>
</App>
```

Query parameters are not considered to be part of the route. So, in this sample, the Winter report and Summer report match the same route, "/report." If you select any of them, both links are marked active:

<Playground
  height={140}
  name="Example: multiples active links simultaneously"
  app={`
    <App layout="vertical">
      <NavPanel>
        <NavLink to="/">Home</NavLink>
        <NavLink to="/report?from=December&to=February">Winter Report</NavLink>
        <NavLink to="/report?from=June&to=August">Summer Report</NavLink>
      </NavPanel>
      <Pages>
        <Page url="/">
          Home
        </Page>
        <Page url="/report">
          Reported period: {$queryParams.from}-{$queryParams.to}
        </Page>
      </Pages>
    </App>
  `}
/>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ“”">
The semantic meaning of routes is analogous to routes used at the backend. When you send two requests with the same routes but different query parameters, they will reach the same backend endpoint. Of course, that endpoint may consider the query parameters, process them, and respond differently. However, this differentiation is not in the routing but in the processing mechanism.
