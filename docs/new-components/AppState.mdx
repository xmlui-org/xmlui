# AppState [#component-appstate]

<Callout>**Note**: This component does not show up on the UI; it merely helps implement UI logic.</Callout>

AppState is a functional component (without a visible user interface) that helps store and manage the app's state.

## Properties

### `bucket (default: "default")`

This property is the identifier of the bucket to which the `AppState` instance is bound. Multiple `AppState` instances with the same bucket will share the same state object: any of them updating the state will cause the other instances to view the new, updated state.

### `initialValue`

This property contains the initial state value. Though you can use multiple `AppState`component instances for the same bucket with their `initialValue` set, it may result in faulty app logic. When xmlui instantiates an `AppState` with an explicit initial value, that value is immediately set. Multiple initial values may result in undesired initialization.

## Events

This component does not have any events.

## Exposed Methods

### `update`

This method updates the application state object bound to the `AppState` instance. The function's single argument is an object that specifies the new state value.

## Styling

This component does not have any styles.
