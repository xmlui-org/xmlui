AppState is a functional component (without a visible user interface) that helps store and manage the app's state.

## Using AppState

Variables in xmlui are a straightforward tool for managing states. However, a variable's scope is the app's main file or the particular component file in which it is declared. To access the variable's value (the stored state), you must pass its value to components wanting to leverage it.

### Storing State in Variables

In the following example, the main file of the app declares a variable, `enhancedMode`, which is toggled with a checkbox:

```xmlui copy filename="Main.xmlui" /enhancedMode/
<App var.enhancedMode="{false}">
  <VStack gap="$space-4" padding="$space-4">
    <Checkbox
      label="Enhanced mode"
      initialValue="{enhancedMode}"
      onDidChange="v => enhancedMode = v" />
    <Component1 enhancedMode="{enhancedMode}" />
    <Component2 enhancedMode="{enhancedMode}" />
  </VStack>
</App>
```

Two components, `Component1` and `Component2`, use the value of `enhancedMode`. Because of the aforementioned scoping issue, the app must explicitly pass the variable's value to those components so that they can use it. These components utilize the value to render their UI:

```xmlui copy filename="Component1.xmlui" /enhancedMode/
<Component name="Component1">
  <H3 when="{$props.enhancedMode}">I am in enhanced mode!</H3>
  <Text when="{!$props.enhancedMode}">Enhanced mode turned off.</Text>
</Component>
```

When you define an `AppState`, you can set its `initialValue` property to initialize the state value.

```xmlui copy filename="Component2.xmlui" /enhancedMode/
<Component name="Component2">
  <Button enabled="{$props.enhancedMode}">Set enhanced options</Button>
</Component>
```

You can try how this app works:

<Playground
  height={200}
  name="Example: AppState"
  components={[`
    <Component name="Component1">
      <H3 when="{$props.enhancedMode}">I am in enhanced mode!</H3>
      <Text when="{!$props.enhancedMode}">Enhanced mode turned off.</Text>
    </Component>
  `,
  `
    <Component name="Component2">
      <Button enabled="{$props.enhancedMode}">Set enhanced options</Button>
    </Component>
  `
  ]}
  app={`
    <App var.enhancedMode="{false}">
      <VStack gap="$space-4" padding="$space-4">
        <Checkbox
          label="Enhanced mode"
          initialValue="{enhancedMode}"
          onDidChange="v => enhancedMode = v" />
        <Component1 enhancedMode="{enhancedMode}" />
        <Component2 enhancedMode="{enhancedMode}" />
      </VStack>
    </App>
  `}
/>

### Storing State in AppState

What if `Component1` and `Component2` had nested components using `enhancedMode`? You must also pass them to the nested components (via properties). What if you have not only one but a dozen of similar properties and a long chain of nested components? The "use a variable" pattern soon becomes a state management nightmare.

If the nested components want to change the state value, you must declare events and event handlers or component APIs to manage the state. It sounds pretty tedious!

This situation is where `AppState` comes into the picture. With an `AppState` instance, you can define a state object that automatically conveys between parent and nested child component chains implicitly.

Let's turn the previous example into one using `AppState`! The following code shows how we change the main app file:

```xmlui copy filename="Main.xmlui" /appState.update/ /appState.value/
<App>
  <AppState id="appState" initialValue="{{ enhancedMode: false }}"/>
  <VStack gap="$space-4" padding="$space-4">
    <Checkbox
      label="Enhanced mode"
      initialValue="{appState.value.enhancedMode}"
      onDidChange="v => appState.update({ enhancedMode: v})" />
    <Component1 />
    <Component2 />
  </VStack>
</App>
```

When you define an `AppState`, you can set its `initialValue` property to initialize the state value. You must give an ID to the `AppState` instance to access it and use the `value` property to get the state. You must invoke the `AppState`'s `update` method when you intend to update the state.

The components may use their own `AppState` object to access the state value:

```xmlui copy filename="Component1.xmlui" /state.value.enhancedMode/
<Component name="Component1">
  <AppState id="state" />
  <H3 when="{state.value.enhancedMode}">I am in enhanced mode!</H3>
  <Text when="{!state.value.enhancedMode}">Enhanced mode turned off.</Text>
</Component>
```

```xmlui copy filename="Component2.xmlui" /state.value.enhancedMode/
<Component name="Component2">
  <AppState id="state" />
  <Button enabled="{state.value.enhancedMode}">Set enhanced options</Button>
</Component>
```
The modified app works the same way as the previous one (using variables):

<Playground
  height={200}
  name="Example: AppState"
  components={[`
    <Component name="Component1">
      <AppState id="state" />
      <H3 when="{state.value.enhancedMode}">I am in enhanced mode!</H3>
      <Text when="{!state.value.enhancedMode}">Enhanced mode turned off.</Text>
    </Component>
  `,
  `
    <Component name="Component2">
      <AppState id="state" />
      <Button enabled="{state.value.enhancedMode}">Set enhanced options</Button>
    </Component>
  `
  ]}
  app={`
    <App var.enhancedMode="{false}">
      <AppState id="appState" initialValue="{{ enhancedMode: false }}"/>
      <VStack gap="$space-4" padding="$space-4">
        <Checkbox
          label="Enhanced mode"
          initialValue="{enhancedMode}"
          onDidChange="v => appState.update({ enhancedMode: v})" />
        <Component1 />
        <Component2 />
      </VStack>
    </App>
  `}
/>

### State Buckets

With the `AppState` component, you can use separate state objects. The `bucket` property of `AppState` is an identifier (using the "default" string by default). While multiple `AppState` objects use the same `bucket` property value, they refer to the same state object.

If you want to run the sample with explicit state buckets (for example, with the `settings` bucket id), you should change the `AppState` declarations accordingly:

```xmlui /bucket="settings"/
<!-- Main.xmlui -->
<AppState id="appState" bucket="settings" initialValue="{{ enhancedMode: false }}"/>

<!-- Component1 -->
<AppState id="state" bucket="settings" />

<!-- Component2 -->
<AppState id="state" bucket="settings" />
```

## Properties

### `bucket (default: "default")`

This property is the identifier of the bucket to which the `AppState` instance is bound. Multiple `AppState` instances with the same bucket will share the same state object: any of them updating the state will cause the other instances to view the new, updated state.

### `initialValue`

This property contains the initial state value. Though you can use multiple `AppState`component instances for the same bucket with their `initialValue` set, it may result in faulty app logic. When xmlui instantiates an `AppState` with an explicit initial value, that value is immediately set. Multiple initial values may result in undesired initialization.

## Events

This component does not have any events.

## Exposed Methods

### `update`

This method updates the application state object bound to the `AppState` instance. The function's single argument is an object that specifies the new state value.

If the argument is a hash object, it will be merged with the previous state value. Let's assume the previous state value was the following:

```json
{
  "enhancedMode": false,
  "showHeader": true,
  "showFooter": true,
  "theme": "light"
}
```

Now, update the state with this call:

```js
appState.update({ enhancedMode: true, theme: "dark" });
```

The new state value will be:

```json
{
  "enhancedMode": true,
  "showHeader": true,
  "showFooter": true,
  "theme": "dark"
}
```

## Styling

This component does not have any styles.
